	* Changed the BUNDLE_INSTALL_DIR from
	  GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR to 
	  GNUSTEP_APPLICATION_SUPPORT 
	  for GNUstep make v2. Bundles are now placed
	  in $(GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN)/Library/ApplicationSupport/GNUMail
	  If you want to install bundles such as the
	  Emoticon or Face bundles in your user domain, simply
	  use:
	  make install GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DOMAIN=USER 
	* Removed the capabilities of loading
	  bundles from ".". Since we now have
	  a GNUMail Framework, it's not an important
	  nor very useful feature anymore.
	* Fixed the bug where we weren't reusing a local
	  cache file for locally-cached mailbox.
	* The "Take Account Offline" menu item now flips
	  to "Take Account Online" on a closed store.

	  reconnecting to an IMAP server.

	  mailbox backend format (mbox / maildir) when
	  initially launching the application.

	* Moved the "Hide deleted messages on startup",
	  "Hide read messages on startup" and
	  "Highlight URLs in message content" options
	  from the Viewing bundle to the Advanced bundle.
	* Reworked the Viewing bundle so it's now possible
	  to select the preferred view style. Only the
	  first two are implemented right now. Also added
	  iconds from Jesse Ross. The OS X nib NEEDS
	  to be modified. 
	* Updates on OS X wrt previous commits.
	* Lots of small cleanups to avoid compiler warnings.


2007-03-24      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added GNUMail+MenuValidation files in order
	  to centralize all menu validation code.
	* Removed the "if possible" words when configuring
	  APOP (for POP3). That means the auth will fail
	  if APOP support isn't available. The OP might
	  prefer that as otherwise, we would try to
	  authenticate using unsecured mechanisms.
	* Added and impleted View > Hide/Show Toolbar
	  and also View > Customize Toolbar...
	* Updated the Xcode project file and MainMenu.nib
	* We now transfer messages from local mailboxes
	  to the local Trash mailbox (if any) when
	  deleting messages and IIF we are hiding
	  deleted messages.
	* We now dynamically add/remove Cc/Bcc
	  fields on Mac OS X during message composition.

          tag name v1.2.0pre3.


2007-02-04      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Reorganized the Message menu.

	  encoded MIME parts.

	  X-Face can't be properly decoded.

	  [NSApp stopModalWithCode: NSRunAbortedResponse]; 
	  This fixes very annoying focus/menu validation
 	  issues under GNUstep.
	* We now properly handle TLS support for SMTP
	  in the Account editing window and we also
	  properly released the used objects.
	* Also fixed an issue with GMail accounts using
	  SMTP. An other fix will soon be committed to
	  Pantomime to fully fix the issue. The fix

2005-01-06      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified a little bit the Console window.
	* Added more progress indicators (using the Console window).
	  We now have them when loading messages (to view them or
 	  their rawsource) or when redirecting them.


2005-01-02      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Removed Icons/stop_{32,48}.tiff

	* Added Icons/stop_32.tiff and Icons/restart_32.tiff.
	  Contribution from Wolfgang Sourdeau <wolfgang@contre.com>
	* Updated the ConsoleWindow's nib. The progress indicator
	  is still not displayed properly under OS X. This
	  issue will soon be resolved.


2005-01-02      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the "Change Text Encoding" feature and
	  integrated with the new async / progress
	  indicator code.
	* Updated the About panel on GNUstep and the
	  property list for the upcoming prerelease.
	* Also updated the About panel on OS X.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -windowDidBecomeMain:
	  to also set the keyEquivalent of the "Deliver"
	  menu item.
	* Modified ImageAndTextCell so it returns YES
	  for isEditable/isSelectable. This allows
	  mailbox renaming to work on OS X.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -setAccountName
	  to always load the accounts and try to select
	  one, even if we receive nil.
        * Set the tag to v1_2_0pre1

	* Modified ConsoleWindowController:  -tableView:
	  objectValueForTableColumn: row: so that when we
	  SEND_SMTP / SAVE_ASYNC / LOAD_ASYNC, we use
	  the total size if the current size is bigger
	  than the former.
	* Added NSPasteboard+Extensions.{h,m}.
	* Replaced nil by @"" in Utilities for the keyEquivalent
	  parameters of ExtendedMenuItem.
	* Finished the message Copy/Cut/Paste code and improved
	  globally the code related to showing progress
	  indicators during lengthy operations.
	* Updated Project Builder's project file to include
	  NSPasteboard+Extensions.{h,m}
	* If we are under GNUstep and closing the last MailWindow,
	  we deselect all items in the Mailboxes window.	
	* Added MailboxManagerController: -folderForURLName: and
	  refactored some code to use it. It's now possible
	  to have a Trash folder on a different store and benefit
	  from all the progress indicator stuff.
	* Removed MailboxManagerController: -folderNameExists: forStore: 
	* Rewrote GNUMail: -applyManualFilter so it works correctly	
	  with the new async and progress indicator code.


2004-12-29      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Removed -storeWithURLNameIsOpen: from
	  MailboxManagerController since we now always
	  keep IMAP stores open.
	* Refactored some of the code in the MailboxManagerController	
	  class for the upcoming rewrite of the item "loading" code.
	* Reactivated the Copy/Cut/Paste code (adapted with the
	  new async code in Pantomime) and remove the code
	  related to the old GNUMail address book format. THIS CODE
	  IS NOT FINISHED. It was commited due to the urgent fix
	  described below.
	* Reworked the account selection code by extending
	  ExtendedMenuItem (to include the account's key) and by
	  removing all the fluff in Utilities.
	* Improved the message copying/cutting code. It should
	  now work very well.


2004-12-28	Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

2004-12-27      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	  OS X whenever we haven't had any mailboxes
	  to open upon GNUMail's startup.


2004-12-26      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	  enable/disable items.

	  Console window) when saving a big message
	  to an IMAP mailbox (either after a message
	  is being sent or when saving a message to
	  the Drafts mailbox).
	* Fix and optimization in the Emoticon bundle.

	  from the Account editing window.
	* Fixed the issue where when showing the raw
	  source of a message, after resizing the
	  window the normal display would be shown.

	  to "jump" when composing an email. Modified
	  EditWindowController: -textDidChange: to
	  keep the selected range and restore it when
	  we are done.
	* We no longer show the "no new messages" panel
	  when the POP3 authentication has failed.
	* Renamed "Inspector" to "Inspector..."

2004-11-21      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

2004-05-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>	

	* Updates wrt previous commits in Pantomime.


2004-05-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -_restoreImage
	  to use the new Pantomime's -isSSL method from
	  the TCPConnection class.


2004-05-11      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the OS X project file and removed the
	  unused navigation view in MailWindow.nib and
	  MessageViewWindow.nib.


2004-05-08      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Fixed a bug in the DnD code if we were hiding
	  deleted or read messages.
	* Fixed a bug in the copy/move messages code
	  (code being used from the context menu).
	* Added NavigationToolbarItem and heavily refactored
	  MailWindowToolbar and MessageViewWindowToolbar to
	  make use of this new class.
	* Modified the loading of accessory views in
	  MailWindowController and modified the Clock
	  bundle so it displays in the toolbar. It does NOT
	  displays right now under GNUstep likely due to a bug
	  in its NSToolbar implementation.


2004-05-04      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Fixed bugs in the PGP bundle on GNUstep wrt
	  the NSToolbar changes.
	* Modified TaskManager: -folderPrefetchCompleted:
	  to clsoe the connection to the POP3 server when
	  no message is on the server.
        

2004-05-03      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca> 
	
	* Updates wrt refactorings done in Pantomime.
	* Added a patch from Wolfgang Sourdeau that
	  adds -acceptableDragTypes in ExtendedTextView
	  so DnD to the message composition window works
	  again under GNUstep.
	* We now automatically open all enabled IMAP
	  accounts when the application starts.
	* Modified EditWindow{Controller} so it also
	  uses a NSToolbar under GNUstep.
	* Same thing for MailWindow{Controller},
	  MessageViewWindow{Controller} and
	  brought back MailboxManagerToolbar.{h,m}
	  for MailboxManager{Controller}.
	* Added MailboxManagerController:
	  -updateOutlineViewForFolder: store: username: in order
	  to refresh only the outline view's item that corresponds
	  to a Store/Folder. This should speeds up A LOT some
	  things in GNUMail (like STATUS's mailboxes in IMAP and
	  displaying messages).
	* Removed the expand/collapse stuff from ExtendedWindow.
	* Added Arabic translation (fixed some bugs in it and
	  converted the file from UTF-8 to UTF-16). The translation
	  was done by Ossama Khayat <okhayat@yahoo.com>.
	* Removed all the old IMAP disconnection code.
	* Removed lots of unnecessary calls to NSTableView:
	  -setNeedsDisplay: in MailWindowController.
	* Modified TaskManager so we now ensure that messages
	  in POP3 were correctly saved on disk before deleting
	  them on the server (all of this is wrt filters).


2004-04-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Applied a small fix to MailboxManagerController: -open
	  to use the right folder separator when using IMAP.
	* Updated the PGP bundle wrt the refactorings in
	  Pantomime.
       

2004-04-21      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the calls from +charsetFromString to
          -charset to reflect the changes done in
	  Pantomime last night.
	* Disabled for now what we did in GNUMail:
	  -applyManualFilter:, -copy:, -cut: and -paste:


2004-04-20      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Minor updates wrt refactorings in Pantomime.
        

2004-04-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Minor updates wrt small changes in Pantomime.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController:
	  -transferMessageFromRawSource: ... to call
	  -parse on a _local_ folder in order to initialize
	  all ivars correctly in LocalFolder.


2004-04-16      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Simplified the code in ExtendedTableView:
	  -dragImageForRows: event: dragImageOffset:.
	* Also simplified the ExtendedOutlineView class
	  by also removing the code for type-ahead support
	  since that won't be used anymore in
	  MailWindowController (that class, for message threading).
	* Simple check added in ConsoleWindowController:
	  -updateToggle. A small bug seems to have been added
	  to NSTableView (GNUstep) recently. This extra
	  check is harmless and "fixes" any potential issues.


2004-04-15      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactorings in the Accounts Preference Panel
	  wrt the SSL changes in Pantomime.
	* Removed some dead code in MailboxManagerController.


2004-04-14      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactorings due to changes in Pantomime's way
	  of handling SSL connections.


2004-04-13      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now correctly save the colors on OS X in RGB.
	  Bug reported (and small fix provided) by
	  Uli Kusterer <Witness.of.TeachText@gmx.net>. 

2004-04-10      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

 	* Changed MailWindowController/MessageViewWindowController
	  to redisplay the selected message after the window has
	  been resized. Removed the old notification based on
	  the MailHeaderCell (that was _not_ resizing the images
	  in a mail, not it does).
      

2004-04-09      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

       * Some more cleanups. Many optimizations after
	 profiling GNUMail. For example, a small cache
	 was added in FolderNode (-path/-setPath) to
	 avoid recalculating the full path in Utilities:
	 -completePathForFolderNode: separator: all
	 the time (was eating ~30% of all CPU for
	 _GNUMail_ alone).
	* Updated all .cvsignore files.


2004-04-08      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

       * Updated the OS X port, finally!


2004-04-02      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

       * Fixed a typo in GNUMail.m. Reported by
	 Jim Tittsler <jim@OnJapan.net>.


2004-04-01      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

       * Fixed a small issue in previous commit.
 

2004-03-31      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Modified GNUMail: -loadBundles to remove any
	  potential duplicate paths in allPaths. Bug
	  reported by Frederik Harwath <fhack@gmx.de>
	  and work based on his submitted patch.
        

2004-03-29      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Use -scrollPoint: instead of -scrollRangeToVisible:
	  so it works the same way on OS X and GNUstep (since
	  OS X shows the indent, but GNUstep doesn't).
	* Updated German translation. Patch from
	  Frederik Harwath <fhack@gmx.de>.
 	* Removed most of the NSOutlineView code from
	  MailWindowController and modified the sources
	  to reflect that change.
	* Fixed a tiny mem leak in Utilities: 
	  +completePathForFolderNode: separator:
       

2004-03-26      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Reduced the minimum size of the Mailboxes window
	  under GNUstep.
	* Removed some completed TODO items.
        

2004-03-25      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the code wrt the changes made in Pantomime.


2004-03-24      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Renabled the support for saving the column's width
	  in MailWindowController. A new user default has
	  been created for it and the old one is automatically
	  removed when starting up the application.
	* Modified the code wrt the changes made in Pantomime.


2004-03-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Changes wrt cleanups done in Pantomime.


2004-03-21      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Optimized MailHeaderCell by removed some code.
	  Added NSAttributedString+Extensions: -sizeInRect
	  with a dummy implementation. A full implementation
	  will be later used in the MailHeaderCell
	  drawing code. Also fixed a small bug in the latter
	  so we don't draw over the bundles (Face, for example).
	* We no longer allow forwarding/reply/redirecting messages
	  if the content isn't loaded.
	* Small changes wrt the cleanups in Pantomime. YOU MUST
	  UPDATE PANTOMIME.


2004-03-19      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Did some cleanups in the ExtendedMenuItem class.
	* Renamed ExtendedAttachmentCell to
	  ExtendedTextAttachmentCell to be more standard
	  and cleanup the code.
	* Cleaned up the main GNUmakefile.
	* Combined the "Save Attachment" and "Save Text from Message"
	  menu / items to improve the usability.
	* Refactored A LOT the message displaying code. Moved
	  everything from Utilities to NSAttributedString+Extensions.
	  Also created NSColor+Extensions so things are well
	  separated and organized now.
	* Moved the URL highlighting and activation code from
	  Utilities to NSAttributedString+Extensions.


2004-03-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Removed TODO #111 as it has been fixed in a
	  recent commit.
	* Removed the table columns selection from the
	  Viewing Preferences panel and moved everything
	  to the View->Columns menu. The OS X port (the
	  MainMenu.nib file) hasn't yet been updated
	  and the columns size preferences WILL NOT
	  be restored. That will soon be reactivated.
	* Added a fix in MailWindowController: -clickedOnDataView:
	  so it works well if the Status column has moved from
	  it's initial position.
	* Moved Utilities: +appendAddress: toTextField: to
	  EditWindowController (Private).
	* Improved the code (and the resulting usability) of
	  Utilities: +showMessageRawSource:  target:
	* Removed MailWindowController: -_initializeFonts and
	  moved the ivars and caching stuff to NSFont+Extensions.


2004-03-16      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a Turkish translation made by
	  Ismail Aslan <ismail@iaslan.com>. Patch sent
	  by Gurkan Sengun <gurkan@linuks.mine.nu>.
	* Updated the code to enforce secure mode on
	  files after writing them on disk.


2004-03-15      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Enhanced the usability of the message threading
	  activation / deactivation. More work needs
	  to be done especially wrt efficiently handling
	  the notification for MessageViewWindowController
	  and when the notification comes from a folder
 	  different than the shown folder.
	* Refactored the MailHeaderCell class and optimized
	  it a little bit (to avoid method calls).


2004-03-14      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added NSBezierPath+Extensions and ThreadArcsCell.
	* Added an initial implementation of Thread Arcs.
	  A LOT more to come today!
	* Bunch of fixes / refactorings wrt previous commits.
	* Added the new classes to the OS X project file.
	  Thread Arcs do work under OS X bug clicking
	  on the cell does nothing for now (investigating
	  this issue...)


2004-03-13      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated flagged-flag.tiff - new image from
	  Stefan Urbanek.


2004-03-12      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -clickedOnDataView:
	  to refresh the view rect of the modified row
	  (just to be safe...).


2004-03-11      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified TaskManager to reset the _counter ivar
	  to 0 when checking mail for all accounts have
	  been invoked.
        

2004-03-10      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the OS X project file and added MailWindowController:
	  -clickedOnDataView: in order to be able to set directly
	  the flags instead of going through the menu.


2004-03-09      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Reworked the ExtendedCell class.
	* Added the possiblity to "flag" messages. Added
	  Icons/flagged-flag.tiff and renamed "new-flag.tiff"
	  to "recent-flag.tiff". This is initial support, more
	  work needs to be done and the OS X port NEEDS to
	  be updated.
	* Removed some unused code in GNUMail.{h,m}. The method
	  -openInNewWindow was no longer being used after we
	  switched to single-click support to open mailboxes.


2004-03-08      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Removed old, unused code in GNUMail+Extensions.m
	* Updated the OS X project file (added NSFont+Extensions
	  and bumped up the OS X version number).
	* Updated the AboutPanel.nib file to match the one
	  used under GNUstep (added missing contributors).
        

2004-03-07      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a small cache for fonts used when displaying
	  messages. This speed up greatly the message 
	  displaying code.


2004-03-05      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Small change in MailWindowController wrt previous
	  commits in Pantomime.
	* Added NSFont+Extensions.{h,m} and refactored some
	  code. The OS X project file NEEDS to be modified
	  to include those new files.
	* Removed completed items from docs/TODO


2004-03-04      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Reactivated the animation in the MailWindow:s
	  when tasks are active.
	* Updated the code to use the notification sent
	  by Pantomime when the raw source of a message
	  in IMAP has been fully received.
	* Small optimization in MailWindowController.
	* Did some refactorings in MailWindowController.
	* Added back support for VirtualFolder:s (local
	  mailboxes only, no search/expunge support for now)


2004-03-01      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the code wrt recent changes in Pantomime.
	  You MUST get the LATEST version of Pantomime.


2004-02-27      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now listen to notifications when the message's data
 	  was fully prefetched instead of using the delegate
	  method. This fixed LOTS of small annoyance in the
	  new IMAP code. YOU MUST UPDATE PANTOMIME.


2004-02-24      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a crash bug in the AccountEditorWindowController
	  if the password was wrong when connecting to the IMAP
	  server for list mailboxes (for example).
	* Bumped up the version number to 1.2.0.
	* Fixed a bug in EditWindowController when accounts where
	  changed during the composition of a message. The transport
	  popup wasn't updated correctly.
	* Removed some unused code in MailWindowController.m


2004-02-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Removed the limitation of needing to close the IMAP
	  account before modifying it. Still more work needs
	  to be done especially wrt changing the port for
	  example. Also fixed a memory leak and we now correctly
	  close the IMAP connection if it was opened to
	  subscribe/unsubscribe to mailboxes (for example).
 

2004-02-22      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the code to bring back support for creating,
	  deleting and renaming mailboxes. Work needs to be
	  done in order to support well errors that
 	  could occur.
	* Refactored and cleaned up quite a good amount of code.
	* Updated NewMailboxPanel.nib
	* Updted ConsoleWindow.nib
	* Fixed a small issue in MailboxManagerController wrt
	  reloading the folders list.
	* Small fix when displaying the account name in case
	  the auth failed when sending a message using SMTP.


2004-02-20      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Disabled the delegate method in MailboxManagerController
	  invoked when collapsing nodes. A better way to close
	  the IMAPStore will have to be found (if we, of course
	  want to offer such functionnality).
	* Modified TaskManager: -addTask to prevent adding
	  tasks that are already in the runqueue (for POP3
	  and IMAP STATUS).
	* Modified MailWindowController: -updateDataView
	  to NOT change the selection if a row is already selected.
	* We now correctly enable/disable the buttons in the
	  Console window when a task terminates.
	

2004-02-17      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Applied a couple of patches from Andreas Heppel
	  to fix some small issues and support submenus in
	  the Copy To/Move To context menu.
	* Refactored some code to use the macro in order to
 	  add messages in the Console window and optimized
	  things a little bit.
	* We now draw a progress indicator when STATUS'ing
	  IMAP mailboxes. The progress indicator is based
	  on the number of mailbox on which to do the
	  STATUS operation. Also fixed a drawing bug in
	  the console.


2004-02-16      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small POP3 crash issue if we can't obtain
	  the lock to the mailbox.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -_restoreImage to
	  correctly restore the "lock" image when using
	  IMAP over SSL.
	* Updated the code to fully work when connecting to
	  services in background.


2004-02-15      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Disabled for now the code to automatically reopen
	  the IMAP mailboxes that were open when the user
	  did quit the application.
	* Small modifications over some constant changes
	  in Pantomime.
        

2004-02-14      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Lots of improvements wrt the new Pantomime code.


2004-02-13      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Fixed the authentication problems wrt the
	  new IMAP code.
	* Small optimizations.
        

2004-02-12      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* More fixes wrt the new I/O code in Pantomime.
        

2004-02-11      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Same as yesterday :)
	* Removed BounceWindow.nib from the repository.
	* Updated MainMenu.nib
	* Updated ConsoleWindow.nib


2004-02-10      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Again, LOTS of improvements on top of the 
          previous commit.


2004-02-09      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed some TODO entries.
	* Removed the spinning GNUstep logo in the Console
	  window. The OS X nib needs to be modified to remove
	  the progress indicator from that same window.
	* Enhanced greatly the Console window, still more to come.
	* Massively modified the code wrt IMAP. THE CODE WILL NOT
	  FULLY WORK RIGHT NOW SO DON'T USE IT.
        * LOTS of improvements on top of the previous commit.


2004-02-08      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed BounceWindow* from the OS X project file.
	  the nib NEEDS to be wiped out from the repository.
	* Removed GNUMail+TaskManager from the OS X project file.
        * Updated the OS X port wrt all changes made in the     
          last weeks. It does NOT work right now, it just compiles.


2004-02-07      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

 	* Added a couple of minor fixes to the Console window.
	* Moved all the message redirection code from BounceWindowController
	  to EditWindowController and removed all BounceWindow* files.
	* Small UI glitch fix in Console window
	* We don't set the window's document as edited in EditWindowController
	  when we are redirecting a message.
       

2004-02-06      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified the Face bundle so it loads faces in background.
	  That allows GNUMail to not block when loading faces
	  from slow web servers. 
        

2004-02-05      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now draw the progress indicator in the console
	  window the way it should look under GNUstep.
	* Added initial support for stopping activities
	  from the Console window.
	* Minor drawing enhancements to the progress indicator
	  drawing code in the Console window.
	* Fixed a couple of small issues.
	* Renamed "Bounce" to "Redirect" in the GNUstep menu.
	* Added an initial implementation of the progress
	  indicator for POP3 activities...


2004-02-04      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Created a custom cell for the progress manager in the
	  new Console window. It will have to be moved to its
	  own file eventually.


2004-02-03      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Removed GNUMail+TaskManager.h and GNUMail+TaskManager.m
	  Moved most of the code in TaskManager and started to clean
	  up things.
	* We now correctly remove the POP3 tasks from the queue
	  if the authentication failed.
	* Started to reimplement the Console window.
	* We now fire the tasks right away when they are added
	  in the _tasks array and improved some more the
	  Console window.
	* Fixed lots of compiler warnings.
	* Minor refactorings
	* Fixed the bouncing code.
	* Added an initial progress indicator for the SMTP code.


2004-02-02      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Updated the code wrt the CC/BCC/TO/... #defines changes
	  in Pantomime.
	* Added a patch from Dirk Olmes so it's now possible
	  to not automatically reopen the last folder that
	  was open when the user quitted the app.
	* Updated the UI of ComposeView to be able to chose the
	  default encoding when sending mails. The code to actually
	  use that isn't there yet. Nothing on OS X has been to done
	  either.
	* Massively updated the code wrt the changes in Pantomime
	  for non-blocking I/O. Mainly modified GNUMail+TaskManager
	  and TaskManager. Left a lot of old code right now in it
	  to be sure we get the same feature set once I'm done.
	  IT WILL NOT WORK RIGHT NOW UNDER OS X.


2004-01-19      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Simplified and optimized MailboxManagerController:
	  -outlineView: acceptDrop: ... to support server-side
	  copy/move operations for IMAP.
	* Small changes wrt the NSRegEx -> CWRegEx class renaming
	  in Pantomime.


2004-01-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added support for the image/pnm MIME type in
	  MimeTypeManager: -_loadStandardMimeTypes.
	* Cleaned the previous code wrt images displaying
	  since GNUstep has now native support for jpg, png, etc.
	  If you no longer see images in your mails (inline),
	  please update GNUstep.
	* Added support for renaming mailboxes directly in
	  the mailboxes drawer / window. Cleaned up a lot
	  of code. 
	* Updated the OS X project file (and the code) so the
	  last commits do work well under OS X.


2004-01-17      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a new class: ExtendedFileWrapper. This class
	  overwrites some of the normal behavior of NSFileWrapper
	  to automatically create zip/tar archives when initializing
	  it using a directory. Modified the GNUMail code to use it.


2004-01-14      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a small check in MailWindowController:
	  -tableView: didReceiveTyping: so we do nothing
	  if the user has typed only whitespace characters.
	* Added a patch from Ken Ferry <kenferry@mac.com>
	  to add support for type-ahead when using
	  message threading.
	* Modified docs/TODO to remove completed items.


2004-01-13      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Applied a patch from Ken Ferry <kenferry@mac.com>
	  to support type-ahead in the message list (when
	  NOT using message threading). That could would
	  need to be ultimately retouched to also support
	  the ExtendedOutlineView. 
        

2004-01-11      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* More wort wrt context menus, especially the one in
	  the message list. Also refactored some code in
	  MailboxManagerController.
	* Updated the code wrt the flags changes in Pantomime.
	* We no longer change the selection on right-click if the
	  number of selected rows > 1.
	* We no longer check for the EnableContextMenus default
	  on OS X since we always show the context menus.
	* Updated PGPController.m wrt changes in Pantomime.


2004-01-05      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added an option in the Advanced Preferences panel
	  to be able to enable or not context menus under GNUstep.
	  By default, they are disabled.
	* Updated the German translation. File provided by
	  Hermann Gundel <Hermann.Gundel@nussberg.de>
	* Fixed an issue wrt the previous commit and added an initial context
	  menu for the message list. Also cleaned up lots of code.


2004-01-04      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Removed the copy/move buttons in the Mailboxes window.
       	 

2004-01-03      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Lot of refactorings wrt Mac OS X compatibiliy and related
	  to all the bugs I've fixed in the GNUstep's NSOutlineView class.
	  With those modifications and my GNUstep patch, DnD is now supported
	  from the MailWindow:s to the Mailboxes window under GNUstep, woo!!!
	  More work is coming wrt to this soon...
	* Cleared a small FIXME in MailboxManagerController: -open: that would	
	  likely cause mailbox selection problems on OS X (and also under GNUstep,
	  just more rarely).


2004-01-02      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Bumped up the version number to 1.1.3.
	* We no longer draw those silly "open/closed" folder
	  icons in the Mailboxes drawer on OS X. Also removed
	  those icons from the OS X project file.
	* We now use openFolder and openFolder_osx as the
	  mailbox icon.
	* Removed closedFolder.tiff and mailboxes_16.tiff from
	  the repository.
	* Updated the OS X project file wrt the previous commit.
	* Updated sort_down.tiff and sort_right.tiff and re-enabled
	  the ExtendedOutlineView use in the GNUstep Mailboxes window.
	* Removed the Copy/Move Messages from the Mailboxes's drawer
	  contextual menu since that doesn't make any more sense to
	  use it. This feature will be reactivated soon, in a contextual
	  menu in the MailWindow's dataView.
	* Removed ExtendedOutlineView: -isExpandable: since it's pretty
	  much useless (and was only used on OS X).


2004-01-01      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Started the work on single-click support in the Mailboxes
	  window / drawer. It also supports creating vfolder for
	  local mailboxes.
          THIS STUFF IS RATHER EXPERIMENTAL. IT WORKS BUT USE
          IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!
	* We now automatically select the "current" mailbox in the
	  Mailboxes drawer / window when its associated MailWindow
	  becomes the key window. It doesn't work yet for VirtualFolder:s.


2003-12-30      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Reworked the message replying code to use
	  the new code in Pantomime and to also offer
	  a "Reply Simple" option that won't put any content
	  in the replied message.
	* Added basic support for the new VirtualFolder class
	  of Pantomime. You can now open a folder that holds
	  mailboxes to see all the messages in those mailboxes
	  in the same MailWindow.
	* Updated the OS X port wrt the previous changes.
        * Fixed a _very_ lame bug in the mbox importing code
          (paths related).
	* We now correctly "toggle" the Find window, the Console
	  window, the About panel and the Address Book panel.
	  Also cleaned some code wrt this (defined a macro).


2003-12-29      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* We now use the row's color (from the filters) to
	  in the MailHeaderCell.
	* Modified ConsoleWindowController so that we use
	  the information from the sending key if there's
	  one defined.
	* Removed unused variables.
	* Did some cleanups in EditWindowController.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -windowShouldClose:
	  to use a sheet under OS X when warning the user a task
	  is running.
        

2003-12-26      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set the CVS tag to v1_1_2
        * RELEASED VERSION 1.1.2


2003-12-25      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the OS X version of the Filtering bundle.
	* Added Matt, Ken and Bjorn in the About panel.
	* Simplified and optimized the Filtering bundle
	  initialization code under GNUstep.
	* Removed some NSLog() calls in the Import bundle
	* We don't save an "empty MailWindow" in the prefs


2003-12-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now disable the "Use secure connection" buttons
	  in the AccountEditorWindow if the SSL bundle is not
	  installed under GNUstep (it's always installed with
	  our dmg on the OS X version).
	* Updated the German translation. Work done by
	  Hermann Gundel <Hermann.Gundel@nussberg.de>


2003-12-21      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified AdvancedViewController to no longer
	  statically allocate everything.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -deleteMessage
	  to use the new Folder's method (-setFlags: messages:)
	  in order to accelerate IMAP messages deletion.


2003-12-09      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We no longer check all IMAP accounts
	  but only opened ones.
	* We no longer remove the DELTED message flag when
	  deleting from the keyboard.


2003-12-07      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the "Open on startup" feature in the Mailboxes
	  window / drawer. GNUMail.app will now automatically
	  reopen the mailboxes that were opened when the app
	  was closed.


2003-12-06      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added an extra check in MailboxManagerController: -outlineView:
	  acceptDrop: .. since the GNUstep's NSOutlineView code is
	  broken wrt DnD. Savannah is still down so I can't fix the
	  real bug :(


2003-11-29      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now STATUS all IMAP folders for an opened IMAP connection
	  in a separate thread when clicking on the "Get" button. We no
	  longer only NOOP the IMAP store.


2003-11-27      Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Added AddressBook framework to the Filtering target based on the 
	  previous change.
	* Fixed crash on quitting on OS X. Setting MailWindowController dataSource to 
	  nil in MailWindowController: -dealloc was triggering a updateStatusLabel (via 
	  tableViewSelectionDidiChange) which tried to contact the already dealloced 
	  MailboxManagerController instance.


2003-11-22      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -_reloadFoldersForIMAPStoreWithName: ...
	  to also use -reloadItem: under GNUstep since that method has been
	  fixed lately.
	* Reverted the change. -reloadItem is still plain broken.
	* Added a patch from Bjorn Giesler to enhance the filtering code
	  to support address book groups. The OS X nib NEEDs to be modified.
	* Added Bjorn in the AboutPanel's list of contributors.
	* Fixed a warning in MailWindowController: -windowWillClose.


2003-11-18      Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Added Constants.m to the OS X project file.


2003-11-09      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Constants.m and cleaned the header. That
	  new file _must_ be added to the OS X project file.


2003-11-08      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Matt Ackeret and Ken Ferry to the About panel.
	* We now properly call -controlTextDidChange: in the
	  -takeTo* methods (in EditWindowController) in order
	  to correctly enable the Send button.
	* Updated ViewingView.nib
	* Updated AboutPanel.nib
	* Updated InfoPlist.strings


2003-11-07      Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Fixed typo in AddressBookController.m


2003-11-07      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Fixed a compiler warning in GNUMail.m
	* Added patches from Bjorn Giesler to:
	   - improve address completion
	   - implement the "preferred label" in AddressBookPanel
	   - convert the Mailboxes window and Console window to
	     panels. This is a quick hack since the classes NEED
	     to be renamed eventually. 
	* We no longer force the ADScreenNameFirstNameFirst since
	  we'll use the user's default in AddressManager.
	* Removed the "Mailbox" string the in Mailboxes's drawer
	  for the contextual menu.
	* Renamed Id -> Number in the Viewing pref panel under GNUstep.
	  The OS X nib needs to be modified.
	* We now save correctly the order of MailWindow's dataView columns.
	* Added a simple patch from David Ayers for key comparisons
	  in AccountViewController.m.


2003-11-05	Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Improved AddressBookPanel.nib.

2003-10-30      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now correctly synchronize our popups in the FilterEditorWindow.
	* We now correctly reload the table columns when changing the
	  dataview type in MailWindowController.


2003-10-29      Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added modal sheet to "Save message as text" action in GNUMail.
	* An address (to|cc|bcc) must be defined for the send button to
	  be active in EditWindowController.
	* Fixed color space in ColorsViewController (Colors bundle).

	
2003-10-27      Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Improved behavior of modal sheet in EditWindowController when
	  closing an unsaved message.
	

2003-10-26      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed two more observers in GNUMail: -applicationShouldTerminate:
	  and reorganized all the calls in MailWindowController: -dealloc.
	* Defined ReloadMessageList in Constants.h so it's cleaner.


2003-10-20      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We no longer require the user to specify a To: recipient.
	* Also fixed a bug in the filtering code wrt trailing ">"
	  when the criteria operation is "has suffix". Issues reported
	  by Alistair Windsor <awindsor@onetel.com>. 


2003-10-19      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Simplified the code a little bit in AddressBookController.
	* Simplified it some more and reactivated AddressBookController:
	  -addressesWithSubstring: so it's now possible to filter incoming
	  mails based on the recipients / Apple's Address Book (or
	  GNUstep's implementation). This fixes TODO #33.
	* Renamed a local variable to not conflict with an ivar on OS X.
	* Added AddressBook_32.tiff and modified the AddressBookPanel.nib
	  to use it.
	* Enhanced MailboxImport.nib.
	* Lots of very minor improvements wrt the Vera font.
	* Modified MailboxImportController: -dealloc to set the datasource
	  of our table view to nil.
	* Did the same thing for the outline view shown in MailWindow's drawer
	  under OS X.


2003-10-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -transfer: so that
	  we use a local autorelease pool when transferring messages
	  between two differnent stores in order to not overload
	  the mail pool.
	* We now correctly close all open Store:s when quitting the
	  application (so we don't leave open IMAP connections to
	  servers that will eventually timeout). That code was
	  in MailboxManagerController: -dealloc but it has been
	  moved to GNUMail: -applicationShouldTerminate.
	* Added a "Quit Anyway" button when the user is quitting
	  the application with running tasks.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -windowDidLoad to remove
	  the broken window autosaving calls and rather add the
	  same thing for our outline view inside our drawer.
	* Updated the OS X project file to remove deleted files
	  from the CVS (wrt the old address book code).
	* Removed AddressBookWindow.nib and added AddressBookPanel.nib
	* Removed Address_add.tiff and Address_delete.tiff
	* Finally updated the address book code under OS X so it's
	  now fully usable. Some things need to be implemented but
	  most of the work has been done.
	* Modified the mailbox import bundle to close the window
	  when the import is completed.
	* Modifed the mailbox import bundle loading code so it's
	  simpler and should work on OS X.	
	* Done the MailboxImport.nib (for OS X), used by the
	  mailbox import bundle.
	* Cleaned some old code that was useless wrt bundle
	  loading under OS X.


2003-10-17      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindowController:  _openPanelDidEnd:
	  returnCode: contextInfo: to verify if the file
	  is readable before attempting to add it as
	  an attachment.


2003-10-15      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified AddressBookController so that when you double-click
	  on an address in the AddressBookPanel but no composion window
	  is open, we open a new one.
	* Added an "open" button in the AddressBookPanel to start
	  "Address Book" or "AddressManager"


2003-10-14      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added GNUMail+Extensions: -update_111_to_112 to remove
	  the "ADDRESSBOOK_TYPE". Also removed the -update_1099_to_110
	  and -removeDeprecatedDefaults methods.
	* Rewrote entirely the Address Book code to use only the
	  Addresses.framework or Apple's implementation. Removed:
	  Group.h, Group.m, Address.h, Address.m, AddressBook.h,
	  AddressBook.m, AddressBookWindow.h, AddressBookWindow.m.
	  Added: AddressBookPanel.h and AddressBookPanel.m.


2003-10-13      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set the About panel on OS X as a floating panel.


2003-10-11      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Lots of minor UI fixes wrt Vera font (reported by
	  Christopher Culver).


2003-10-10      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Updated the code wrt the refactorings made in Pantomime.
	* Modified the Account bundle to add IMAP SASL mechanisms
	  support for authentication.
	* Updated some nibs wrt the previous commits made in the past days.
	* Updated the OS X project file to set the version number to 1.1.2.


2003-10-08      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the code to no longer use TCPConnection's isConnected
	  but rather use the Store's implementation.
	* Removed the "Show " for menu items / buttons for both
	  Raw Source / Normal Display and All Headers / Filtered Headers.	


2003-10-06      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified AutoCompletingTextField: -tableView: objectValue...
	  to ensure the index lies inbound in the completion array.
	* Added an option in the "Receive" tab of the Account Editor Window
	  to never check mail for a specified account. This is useful
	  for "send only accounts".
	* Enhanced the UI for the POP3 "Receive options" tab.
 

2003-10-05      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the initial version of the "Import" bundle.
	  This bundle is accessible from the "Mailbox > Import Mailboxes..."
	  menu item and works only under GNUstep right now (the
	  OS X nib will soon be done and also the bundle loading code will
	  be adapted).
	* Bumped version number to 1.1.2 in the GNUstep plist.
	* Improved the message when the send operation failed so the
	  user is aware that he can save the message in the Drafts folder
	  using the Console window.


2003-09-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

 	* Fixed a small bug that happened when closing an IMAP
	  store using the Mailboxes's window and having a sort
	  order different then by #.
       

2003-09-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added an advanced pref option to enable/disable
	  continous spell checking during email composition
	  (disabled by default).
	* Add the first parts of the code for IMAP multithreading.
	  The STATUS operations are now done in the worker thread.
	* When closing the IMAP store, instead of closing the 
	  associated MailWindow (if any), we set its folder to nil.


2003-09-28     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed docs/NIBS from the OS X project file.
	* Minor improvements in the Account bundle.
	* Improvements when first starting GNUMail.app
	  (first time user).
	* Minor improvements in the Fonts bundle for OS X.
	* Removed inexistant headers in the OS X project file.
	* Improved the message on OS X when the user removed
	  all its mailboxes but left the preferences file around.
        * Set the CVS tag to v1_1_1
        * RELEASED VERSION 1.1.1


2003-09-27     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Minor cleanups in AccountEditorWindowController.m
        

2003-09-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a warning when adding a new IMAP account showing
	  all mailboxes (instead of only subscribed mailboxes).
	  Suggestion from Matt Ackeret <mattack@apple.com>.
	* Removed the NSPopUpButtonCell category as the
	  enabled / disabled cell bug was fixed in GNUstep.


2003-09-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -outlineView: willDisplayCell: ...
	  to actually NOT show our Drafts/Inbox/Sent/Trash icon if the item
	  has children to avoid UI glitches when using IMAP.
	* Removed docs/NIBS
	* Updated docs/README and docs/WHOIS


2003-09-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -windowDidBecomeKey:
	  to correctly update the Thread / Unthread Messages
	  menu item.
	* Modified AutoCompletingTextField: -tableViewSelectionDidChange:
	  to ensure our selected row is valid.
	* Modified AutoCompletingTextField: -moveDown: / -moveUp:
	  to use [_sharedDropDownTableView numberOfRows] instead of
	  [_cachedCompletions count] to ensure that our selected row
	  stays inbound.
	* Removed the "Charset" option in EditWindow/EditWindowController
	  and changed the Message > Text Encodings code to be able to
	  set the encoding of a message being composed.
	* Updated EditWindow.nib wrt the previous commit.


2003-09-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now use the right separator when accepting drops
	  in MailboxManagerController.
	* Set the "Find:" field to the findAll: target
	  in FindWindow.m (GNUstep).


2003-09-21     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the "Enter Selection" feature.
	* Linked the "Enter Selection" menu item to the
	  right outlet on OS X.
	* Modified Utilities (Private): +_attributedStringFromTextForPart:
	  to use Pantomime's new html stripping method (instead of doing
	  it again ourself in GNUMail.app). YOU MUST UPDATE PANTOMIME.
	* Fixed all (hopefully) issues wrt DnD of TIFF images directly
	  in the message composition window.


2003-09-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed all issues wrt the EditWindowToolbar under
	  OS X (crashes after toolbar customization).
	* Reconnected the "Delete" menu item to the right action.
	* Fixed a mem leak wrt the previous commit for
	  EditWindowToolbar.
	* Did the same fixes wrt toolbars customization in
	  MailWindowController/Toolbar and BouceWindowController/Toolbar.


2003-09-19     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed some completed TODO items.
	* Modified GNUMail: -showMailboxManager: so that
	  under GNUstep, if the Mailboxes window is shown and
	  this method is invoked again (either by clicking on the
	  "Mailboxes menu item / MailWindow's button), we hide it.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -delete: to fix the
	  IMAP cache deleting code. It was removing the wrong caches
	  (the cache files of all children of its parent mailbox!)
	* Modifed the width of the "Delete Address / Group" and
	  "Modify" buttons in AddressBookWindow so they look
	  better when using the Vera font.


2003-09-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set a key-equivalent for the "Preferences..." menu
	  item under GNUstep (same as OS X).
	* When closing the EditWindow, we correctly close the
	  AutoCompletingTextField drop down (added an observer).


2003-09-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modifed GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching so that
	  we show the Mailboxes's window _before_ any MailWindow:s
	  under GNUstep.
	* Modified GNUMail: -applicationShouldTerminate: to properly
	  close the Mailboxes's window (under GNUstep) and the
	  Console's window (OS X and GNUstep) before releasing
	  the singletons.
	* Set the next key views (under GNUstep and partly under OS X
	  for the Send and Receive views in the Account editor window.
	* Updated MailWindow.nib (to remove the matrix), the PB project
	  file (Face/PGP targets) and generalized the Face.m code to use
	  the same code under OS X and GNUstep.
	* Modified the Face bundle to scale its image proportionally to
	  the max of the width or height of the original image in order
	  to keep the aspect ratio.
        

2003-09-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added Nicolas Roard's art work for the Face and
	  PGP bundles. Added parts of his patch to enhance both
	  bundles.
	* Majorly reworked the Face and PGP bundles. Removed
	  the the "status bar" type of bundles. The OS X nib
	  (MailWindow.nib) _needs_ to be modified as well as
	  the OS X project file for the Face and PGP bundles.
 	*****************************************************
	* YOU MUST RECOMPILE AND RE-INSTALL THE FACE AND    *
	* THE PGP BUNDLES AFTER UPDATING TO TODAY'S VERSION *      
 	*****************************************************


2003-09-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the tiff compression in all the images
	  from the Emoticon bundle. It should now work well
	  under OS X as well (untested).
	* Modified AutoCompletingTextFied: -complete: to be sure
	  the table index we select is valid.
	* Added a patch from Stefan Urbanek to add more emoticons.
	* Added a patch to the Face bundle from Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com>
	  to fix the drawing of X-Face under GNUstep. 


2003-09-14     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added a patch from Ken Ferry <kenferry@mac.com>
	  to entirely redo the address completion code in
	  EditWindow. Added the AutoCompletingTextField class and
	  removed the old AddressComboBox class. Cleaned some
	  of the code so it works under GNUstep. Some bugs are
	  still in there but we'll start from there and progress.
	  The OS X project file/nib need to be modified.
	* Updated the OS X project file and EditWindow.nib to use
	  the AutoCompletingTextField.
	* Modified 99% of the UI under GNUstep so that UI elements
	  fit rather well when the Vera font is used.
	* Updated the OS X project file to add an "Emoticon" target
	  (for our new bundle). Cocoa has problems with the tiff files
	  and they will have to be fixed before the bundle fully work
	  under OS X.
 

2003-09-13     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added the "Emoticon" bundle to the repository. This
	  bundle replaces emoticons with images in the text view
	  displaying the current selected message. It serves as a
	  good example on how to develop GNUMail.app bundles.
        

2003-09-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the key equivalent of Mailbox > Mailboxes
	  under OS X to be shift-M (since M is used for 
	  minimizing the window).
	* Updated AccountEditorWindow.nib wrt the new UI
	  of the Send tab.
	* Modified MailWindowToolbar.m to set the label
	  of the mailbox button to "Mailboxes" instead of
	  "Mailbox".
	* Bumped up the version number to 1.1.1.
	* Same thing for the OS X project file.
	* Fixed invalide message count when receiving and transferring
	  messages to a different folder than the one (if any) currently
	  shown.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: _openLocalFolderWithName: sender:
	  so that if we double-click on an item that holds mailboxes (ie., a
	  directory at the file system level), we expand/collapse that item.


2003-09-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Redone the UI (under GNUstep for now) in the "Send" tab
	  of the Account editing window.


2003-09-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController and ExtendedOutlineView to
	  add a contextual menu on OS X for managing mailboxes. The
	  "Open on Startup" feature needs to be fixed.
	* Some fixes wrt the previous commit to avoid compiler warnings.
	* Fixed the "Open on Startup" feature.
	* Modified GNUMail: -applicationShouldTerminate: to reorder the
	  deallocation calls in order to prevent a crash when quitting the
	  app in the Console.


2003-09-06     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Handling encoded URLS in GetURLScriptCommand.m
	* On startup, maibox manager is opened after opening 
	  folders so that the NSDrawer can be opened.
	* toText is initialFirstResponder in EditWindow.


2003-09-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Inverted the key bindings/positions for the next/previous
	  unread messags in MainMenu.nib.
	* We correctly handle exceptions being generated (only under GNUstep)
	  when deleting the cache of an IMAP folder (unsubscribe) for which its name
	  can't be converted in the default C-string encoding.
	* Added a "New Message" item to the dock menu on OS X.


2003-09-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added a patch from Ken Ferry <kenferry@mac.com> to no
	  longer use the "NO_MESSAGE_RENDER_IN_MAIL_WINDOW" default.
	  We rather don't render the message in the MailWindow's textview
	  if its frame's height is 0. Modified docs/PREFERENCES to remove
	  the reference to this default and added an -update_110_to_111
	  method to GNUMail+Extensions to remove that default. 
        

2003-09-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail: -restoreDraft: to NOT release the message
	  at the end of the method. This prevents an ugly segfault. Bug
	  reported by Ken Ferry <kenferry@mac.com>
	* Modified MailboxManagerController wrt the new IMAP code for
	  opening a folder in Pantomime.


2003-08-31     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Reactivated the DnD on OS X to the "Mailboxes drawer"
	  and also the autosaving of columns's width.


2003-08-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified IMAPView (and the related code) to offer a new option
	  for showing all mailboxes (default) or only the subscribed ones.
	  The OS X nib _needs_ to be modified.
	* Modified the PGP bundle to add an "expiry" feature for passphrases.
	  The OS X nib _needs_ to be modified.
	* Updated the nibs wrt the previous commit
	* Removed the MailboxManagerToolbar category (.h/.m files)
	* Removed MailboxManager.nib
	* Added initial implementation of NSDrawer. Right now, the
	  Add/Delete/Rename/Move/Copy/Open at startup "buttons" are gone
	  but will be replaced by a contextual menu soon.
	* Added a new option "New Viewer Window" in the File menu to actually
	  be able to reopen an empty MailWindow when all of them are closed.


2003-08-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a patch from MJ Ray <markj@cloaked.freeserve.co.uk>
	  (with minor modifications) to support the List-Post header
	  when replying to a mailing list.
	* Now also handle "List-Post: NO" by not prompting the
	  "Reply to list" alert panel.


2003-08-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified AccountViewController.m to implement -hasChangesPending:
	  and use it in -saveChanges so we don't fire up notifications that
	  accounts have changed if they haven't. This speeds up the closing
	  of the pref panel a lot.


2003-08-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Connected the "From" NSPopUpButton action in EditWindow.nib
	* Fixed the "status bar" size and position in MailWindow.nib
	  so the "deleted" info is shown properly.
	* The "Repeat the message's subject (message threading)" is now
	  activated by default.
	* Optimized MailWindowController: -updateStatusLabel and added
	  the size of deleted messages.


2003-08-19     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Set the version number of the PGP bundle to 0.6.0 in PGPController.m
        * Set the CVS tag to v1_1_0 
        * RELEASED VERSION 1.1.0


2003-08-18    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed redundant code in EditWindowController:
	  -windowDidLoad.
	* Fixed a bug in Utilities: stringValueOfURLNameFromFolderNode.
	  If the IMAP account was being created, it wouldn't get the username
	  and the servername from the defaults (since they weren't saved yet).
	  Added those two parameters to the class method.
	* Modified AccountEditorWindow.nib to set the initial item for the
	  transport method popup button to be "Mailer" instead of "SMTP".
        * Modified TaskManager: -_sendUsingSendmailForTask: so that if the
          path is invalid, we set the current task as non-running in order
          to not block the task queue.
	* We now also warn the user about the invalid path.
	* Fixed SendingView.nib. Set the next key view on the fields
	  and connected the buttons to the right actions.


2003-08-17    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now use UTF-8 as the string encoding when reading
	  the program's output for a signature.


2003-08-17    Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Minor improvements to various nibs related to the
	  preferences bundles.


2003-08-12    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set the line wrap limit (for format=flowed) to
	  72 when not defined by the user (instead of 998). 
	* Cleaned a couple of FIXME:s in MailWindowController.m


2003-08-10    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified StripeTableView.h so we don't include it
	  under GNUstep and we guard it against multiple
	  inclusion.
	* Modified MailHeaderCell: -init to first try to obtain the color
	  for the cell from the MAILHEADERCELL_COLOR default key.


2003-08-10    Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified HeadersWindow.nib of the Viewing preference
	  bundle so it uses the StripeTableView.


2003-08-09    Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added class StripeViewTable which extends NSTableView
	  and adds blue stripes to get the iTunes look.
	* Modified SwitchTableView class and the nibs related
	  to the Mime and Sending preferences modules to use 
	  the new class.


2003-08-09    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the last Mime-Type -> MIME type typos
	  in the MIME bundle, mainly on OS X.
	* Modified AccountEditorWindowController.m in order to
	  not allow (by adding a delegate method) the editing
	  of IMAPView's NSOutlineView.


2003-08-08    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

       	* Added a NSPopUpButton category in GNUMail.m (at the
	  beginning of the file) to fix a lame bug in GNUstep -gui
	  wrt NSPopUpButton and non-enabled items. This is a temporary
	  fix to at least allow the users to use the application
	  properly until the GNUstep bug is fixed.
 

2003-08-07    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Fixed the last two cases of IMAP disconnection
	  handling code. Woo.
        

2003-08-05    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the code for the NSTableView GNUMail
	  category that was fixing a bug in -deselectAll. It should
	  now be fixed in -gui (being for a long time IIRC).
	* Modified MailWindowController: -_reloadTableColumns: so we
	  don't remove the outlineTableColumn from the NSOutlineView
	  (when using message threading) since it causes a number of
	  issues on OS X.


2003-08-04    Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified code of previous commit so that the modifier key under
	  Mac OS X is the option/alt key instead of the control key which
	  is reserved for contextual menus (not yet implemented in GNUMail).


2003-08-04    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Done TODO #60. You can now Control-double-click on a mailbox
	  to open it in a separate window.
	* Added raw_32.tiff to the OS X project file.
	* Reduced the minimum width of MailWindow.nib's window.
        

2003-08-03    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Now handle two more cases of IMAP disconnection.
	  Only two are left.
        

2003-08-01    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Now handle correctly IMAP disconnection when
	  replying to a mail or forwarding a mail.
	* Done TODO #45 (when viewing a message in a MessageViewWindow
	  and we're at the bottom of the message and hit the spacebar
	  select the next message (same with previous message).
	* Done TODO #96 (now showing a "Raw Source" button in MessageViewWindow
	  under GNUstep and OS X). The OS X project NEEDS to be modified to
	  include raw_32.tiff. Enhancements will soon be commited wrt this
	  feature (like changing the label depending on what is shown)
	* Improvements wrt the previous commit.


2003-07-31    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the "NO_MESSAGE_RENDER_IN_MAIL_WINDOW" default in the
	  Advanced preference panel.
	* Added the "review unsent mails" when quitting the app with
	  unsent Compose windows.


2003-07-30    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Fixed FilteringViewController.m wrt enabling or disabling
	  filters using the checkboxes.  It was causing problems
	  under GNUstep.
	* Modified PreferencesWindowController: -savePreferences:
	  to verify if changes are pending in each bundle before
	  calling -saveChanges on them.
	* Rewrote the Advanced pref panel so it uses a SwitchTableView.
	  It's now way easier to add "advanced" options to GNUMail.app.
	  The OS X nib _needs_ to be updated.
	* Added new option in the Advanced pref panel to automatically
	  expand the threads when switching in message threading mode.
	  Modified MailWindowController to do that if the pref is set.
	* Updated AdvancedView.nib and its controller for OS X.
        

2003-07-29    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a minor bug in the previous commit. The EditWindow
	  was never being closed on GNUstep when saving or not
	  in the drafts folder.
	* Partially reformatted the code in MessageComposition.


2003-07-28    Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified EditWindowController: changed alert box when closing
	  edited message so it is attached to the window.


2003-07-24    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified the code from the previous commit so it is
	  also used under GNUstep.


2003-07-24    Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified MailHeaderCell: added category to NSBezierPath to
	  easily draw rectangles with rounded corners; changed the
	  background under Mac OS X.


2003-07-23    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ExtendedTextView: -updateCursorForLinks so we don't
	  pass an empty range as the selected range on GNUstep. The
	  text system doesn't like that. We pass the normal range instead.
	* Modified Utilities: +loadTransportMethodsInPopUpButton to use
	  -insertItemWithTitle: atIndex: instead of -addItemWithTitle:
	  since the NSPopUpButton class has recently been borked again
	  in GNUstep.


2003-07-22    Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca> 

        * Slightly modified the code from the previous commit so
	  it works under GNUstep.
	* Fixed very small mem leaks.


2003-07-21     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified ExtendedTextView: -updateCursorForLinks so the 
	  cursor change to an hand when moving the mouse over a link.
	  Not tested nor activated under GNUstep yet. 


2003-07-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindowController: -comboBoxWillDismiss: to be
	  sure we always select a valid index from the 
	  addressCompletionCandidates array.


2003-07-14     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added left/right arrow support for collapsing/expanding
	  threads when using message threading. Suggestion received
	  from Matt Ackeret <mattack@apple.com>.


2003-07-13     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

 	* Added "auto scroll" support when approaching the first or last
	  visible row in the MailWindow's dataView.
       

2003-07-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Updated the code to support the new mailboxes flags/name attributes
	  (mostly used for IMAP mailboxes).


2003-07-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the "Send to Address Book" menu item in MainMenu.nib.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -deleteMessage: so that we "reverse"
	  the select if we are in reverse-sorting order. Suggestion from
	  Ian Jones <ian@digital-bushido.org>.


2003-07-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail+TaskManager: -nextTask: to verify if the
          task is also running when immediately returning if we have
          a currentTask defined. This prevents blocking the task queue
          if we have a non-running task in it (ie., a stopped mail being
          sent using SMTP).
        * Modified Utilities: +showMessageRawSource: target: to remove
          any previous selection and also to scroll to the (0,0) range.
	* Modified AccountViewController to fix the sorting issues (in the
	  tableView) and also to fix the way we get the accounts keys.
	  The new way should work way better and fix all issues that
	  were present before if one had the same username@popservername
	  account defined.
	* Changed the minimum size of the "Mailbox" column in the
	  MailboxManager window.


2003-07-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now force some cleanups in TaskManager: -_receiveUsingPOP3ForTask:
	  if an exception occurs when either opening or closing the connection
	  with the POP3 folder.


2003-07-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Changed the button's labels when quitting the app with a
	  Compose window opened.
 	* Removed some unused code in GNUMail+TaskManager: -checkForNewMail: ...
	* Increased the length of a label in ComposeView.m


2003-07-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail+TaskManager: -addTask to not assign the
	  currentTask and modified -nextTask to immediately return
	  if there's already a currentTask. This should fix the
	  never ending POP3 tasks (and that could happen to other
	  kind of tasks) and should help not getting the NSRecursiveLock
	  exception.


2003-07-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the TaskManager to use -performSelectorOnMainThread: ...
	  instead of the NSConnection object to inform the NSApp's delegate
	  that the task has completed. This should fix (it's a workaround)
	  the GNUstep -base recursive lock bug.
	* Modified AccountEditorWindowController to verify (basic verification)
	  if the informations provided in the Send tab are valid.
	* Linked the Next/Previous Unread actions in MainMenu.nib.
	* Changed "Mime-Type" for "MIME type" in the MIME bundle. The OS X nibs
	  need to be updated.
	

2003-06-27     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Minor refactorings in GNUMail.m
	* Added -nextUnreadMessage and -previousUnreadMessage actions
	  to GNUMail.h/.m. The MainMenu nib _needs_ to be updated.
	* Added some notes in GNUMail: -applicationWillFinishLaunching:
	  about key modifiers.


2003-06-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug un my previous commit wrt the new
	  method in NSString+Extensions.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -_replaceSignature
	  to fix the nasty UI bug when the signature was at the
	  beginning of the message. We now prevent attribute shifts
	  by not inserting the attributed string at index 0.
	* Added an "Unthread" option. It is supposed to work but
	  GNUstep's implementation of NSOutlineView seems to be broken
	  (since it doesn't accept a nil dataSource - I'll verify on
	  OS X later and fix it if it should accept one).
	* Modified MailWindowController to set the dataView row size
	  also in -setDataViewType:.


2003-06-25     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Updated MainMenu OS X nib.


2003-06-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed all -sort* methods in GNUMail.m
	* Improved the title of the alert panel when closing
	  the connection to an IMAP store.
	* Cleaned up the code to use the new Pantomime method:
	  stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString: withString: in
	  NSString+Extensions.
	* Renamed RAW -> Raw (or raw) in the code.


2003-06-24     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Renamed "RAW" to "Raw" in the View menu.
	* Mapped the backspace key to the Delete item of the Message
	  menu (under OS X only).

2003-06-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ExtendedTextView to use the same DnD code on
	  both OS X and GNUstep since GWorkspace was fixed.
	* Modified most of the code to handle gracefully being
	  disconnected from the IMAP server.  
	* Modified a couple of nibs wrt previous commits.
	* Added an extra \n to separate the MailHeaderCell from the
	  body of the message under OS X.
	* Modified BounceWindowController to use pathForResource: ...
	  instead of pathForGNUstepResource: ...


2003-06-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Console information while sending messages using SMTP.
	* Cleaned up TaskManager by using cpp macros.


2003-06-21     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added GNUMailTemporaryDirectory() to Utilities and modified
	  the code to NOT use NSTemporaryDirectory() but rather that new
	  function.


2003-06-19     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: +folderNodeForPath: using: to add a
	  separator: parameter. Modified all the code to use this
	  new method and pass @"/" if the folder separator cannot
	  be ".". Pass the IMAPStore's folderSeparator if it can
	  (like in AccountEditorWindowController.m).
	* Removed the word "automatically" from MailboxesView.m
	  wrt the Trash popup. The nib needs to be modified.
	* Removed the "Memory Panel..." menu item and added the support
	  to show it when clicking on the GNUMail "logo" in the AboutPanel.
	  Suggestion from Christopher Culver <crculver@users.sourceforge.net>.
	* Modified SendView and ReceiveView to move the "remember password"
	  checkbox over the password field and set action methods to enable/disable
	  those fields depending on the button state (in the controller). The
	  OS X nibs _need_ to be modified.
	* Added the new GNUMail.app menu hierarchy for GNUstep. Cleaned up some
	  ivar names and removed unused code.
	* Set the key equivalent to the Cancel buttons to the escape key.
	* Modified NSAttributedString+TextEnriched: +_removeCommandsFromAttributedString:
	  to correctly strips everything contained between <param></param>
 

2003-06-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities to NOT prependa \n before displaying
	  a message/rfc822 part.
	* Fixed a bug in the commit of yesterday to fix issue with cache
	  updates for IMAP. It wasn't working if the folder separator was
	  different from "/" (like when using Courier).
	* Fixed some "folder" > "mailbox" UI artifacts. In the _UI_ of
	  GNUMail.app, we should always use the "mailbox" word (and NOT
	  the "folder" word). In the code, we use "folder" to match
	  Pantomime's definition of a folder.


2003-06-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController to fix all (hopefully) issues
	  related to cache updates when using IMAP.
	  This fixes TODO #28.
	* We now use one \n instead of two to separate the message body
	  from the headers. Also fixed a typo.
	* Modified the PGP bundle (PGPController) to use Pantomime's new
	  method in NSData+Extensions (-replaceCRLFWithLF).
	* Did the same thing byt for NSData+Extensions (-replaceLFWithCRLF).


2003-06-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified MailWindowController to implement IMAPFolder's delegate
          methods.


2003-06-14     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set a minimum size for the Console's window under GNUstep.
	* Modified MailWindowController to clear up the text view when
	  no message is selected.


2003-06-13     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Renamed "Outbox" to "Sent" in the UI and everywhere in the code. Also
          added a method to migrate to the new prefs (SENTFOLDERNAME instead of
          OUTBOXFOLDERNAME for all accounts) in GNUMail+Extensions.
        * Updated the nib connection wrt the previous commit.
        * Updated FontsView.nib to add the size "13" in all popup buttons.
        * Updated some nibs to replace "informations" by "information".


2003-06-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a patch from Dirk Olmes <dirk@xanthippe.ping.de> to correctly
	  guess the account name when restoring a message from the Drafts folder.


2003-06-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed MailWindowController: -composeMessage and modified MailWindow
          to set the compose button target to the app's delegate. Did the
          same in MailWindowToolbar.
	* Applied a patch from Dirk Olmes <dirk@xanthippe.ping.de> to correctly
	  guess the account name when composing a message (with minor modifications)


2003-06-09     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed all issues wrt the RECENT/SEEN flags. You MUST update
	  Pantomime.
	* Applied a patch from Dirk Olmes <dirk@xanthippe.ping.de>
	  (with minor modifications) to use the IMAP's store information
	  (if it can) to guess the account name when forwarding/replying
	  to a message.


2003-06-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in the commit of 2003-06-03. We now correctly
	  handle a "nil" separator.
	* Renamed MailboxManagerController: -connectionWasLostToIMAPStore...
	  to -connectionWasLost: (id) sender. This method will be used
	  by the IMAPStore's object (since the MM is their delegate) to notify
	  the MUA in case the server has dropped the connection. This
	  method is NOT FINISHED.
	* Removed all the IMAP connection lost handling code and replaced it
	  (temporarely) with #warning:s.


2003-06-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in Utilities: +URLWithString: matchFolder:.
	  We now use isKindOfClass since 1) GNUstep was unb0rken (call frame)
	  and 2) -setLocalFolderCacheManager no longer exists.
	* Modified GNUMail+TaskManager to only NOOP the IMAP store. We no
	  longer NOOP the IMAP folder. You MUST update Pantomime from CVS.


2003-06-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small memory leak in the previous commit.
	* Improved the "Save in Drafts" alert panel buttons in
	  EditWindowController.
	* Removed a dumb NSLog()


2003-06-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the sources of GNUMail.app wrt the last Pantomime's commit
	  (related to all cache managers used in the app).
	* Applied a patch from Christopher Culver <crculver@users.sourceforge.net> 
	  to change "informations" to "information" everywhere. The nibs need to be
	  updated.
	* Done TODO #112 - rewrote and optimized Utilities:
	  +_quoteMessageContentFromAttributedString:
	* Added a new Colors pref panel icon, maybe by myself from a sshot :)


2003-06-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -outlineView:
	  objectValueForTableColumn: byItem: so that we display 
	  the folder status information for _all_ IMAP folders.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: _reloadFoldersForIMAPStoreWithName:
	  username: account: to correctly replace the folder separator for
	  all subscribed folders of the store we just obtained the list from
	  with "/" in all folder names before storing the values in our folder status
	  information cache (since it deals only with "/" as a separator).
	* Small improvement over the previous commit. We now don't show the folder 
	  message count if it's 0 _and_ if it's an IMAP folder.
	* Fixed the separtor issue in MailWindowController: -updateStatusLabel.
	* Done TODO #99 (Put GNUMail.app's services in a separate Service's submenu)
	

2003-06-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the size 13 in the Fonts panel. Suggestion from
	  Christopher Culver <crculver@users.sourceforge.net>.
	  The OS X nib _needs_ to be updated.
        * We now correctly protect our shared ivar (mustStopTransfer) with
          a NSLock.
        * Cleared a FIXME in ExtendedTextView. "5" is NSDragOperationCopy|NSDragOperationGeneric.


2003-06-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactored the SMTP's sending code in TaskManager to use
	  the new code in Pantomime to report code/messages received from
	  the server in case of an error occurred. You MUST update Pantomime.


2003-05-31     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Make use of floor() instead of floorf() in EditWindowController
	  so the code links under Solaris.
	* Modified the GNUmakefile so we link with libucb under Solaris.
	* Applied a patch from Dirk Olmes <dirk@xanthippe.ping.de> (with
	  modifications) to add a "Deliver - D" menu item in the Message
	  menu.
	* Updated MainMenu.nib wrt the previous commit.
        

2003-05-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Removed NSLog calls in EditWindowController: -_replaceSignature.
	* Removed TODO #3 (Correct the matrix autoresizing mask in MailWindow 
	  to prevent overlapping when resizing the window.). This can no longer
	  happens since we set a reasonable minimum size to the MailWindow:s.
        

2003-05-27     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Added support to specify account name to scriptable MessageComposition class.
	* Fixed bug in "showing" message composition via AppleScript.


2003-05-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added complete X-Face support in the Face bundle. This completes
	  TODO #9.
 

2003-05-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set a minimum size for EditWindow and MessageViewWindow under GNUstep.
	* Removed the "Hide/Show Status Bar" menu item in MainMenu.nib
	* Set the minimum size for MailWindow.nib, EditWindow.nib and MessageViewWindow.nib.
	  This completes TODO #4.
	* Modified ExtendedCell to also draw the interior of the frame under OS X.
 

2003-05-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Modified TaskManager: -_messageFromExternalProgramUsingFilter: message:
	  to write a message to the GNUMail.app Console (instead of using NSDebugLog)
	  if something goes wrong when writing the raw source of the message to
	  a temporary directory.
	* Removed the "Show/Hide Status Bar" option (and related code).
	* Cleaned the popup menu items in NewMailboxPanel.
	* Added Next/Previous Unread message scrolling using the Control-Up/Down
	  key bindings.
	* Modified TaskManager (Private): _receiveUsingUNIXForTask: to move the
	  -taskCompleted call at the end of the method.
	* Fixed all issues with the "Supported SMTP AUTH mechanisms" popup button.
	  This fixes TODO #52.
	* Modified the TaskManager to use -performSelectorOnMainThread: ... when
	  the authentication failed with a SMTP or POP3 server.
	* Did the same for runAlertPanel: ...


2003-05-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set the right intercell spacing for tableviews that draw
	  a different background color for some rows.


2003-05-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed MailboxManagerController: -outlineView: shouldCollapseItem:
	  to correctly get the MailWindow associated to the IMAPStore we are
	  closing and not assume it's the last one on top.


2003-05-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Moved the [super drawInteriorWithFrame:... call in ExtendedCell
	  before compositing the message's flag images.
	* Modified EditWindowController: to move the initializations of some
	  ivars inside the -initWithWindowNibName: method.
	  This prevent a segfault on Solaris (since we can't send messages to nil).
	

2003-05-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified most of the GNUMail+TaskManager/TaskManager code to
	  use -performSelectorOnMainThread: ... instead of the NSConnection
	  object - this makes things way faster.
	* Set a minimum size for the MailWindow on GNUstep
	* Modified the labels on the buttons for the alert panel used
	  to confirm if the user wants to close the IMAP connection (when collapsing
	  a node) to be more intuitive.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -saveMessageInDraftsFolderForController: to
	  mark the window's document as non-edited just after saving the message in the
	  Drafts folder.
	* Refactored some code in MailboxManagerController and GNUMail+TaskManager/TaskManager
	  to remove some code.


2003-05-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added an extra boundary check in 
	  Utilities: +_quoteMessageContentFromAttributedString:
	  

2003-05-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: +_guessAccountNameFromMessage: to first guess
	  the complete address before guessing only for the domain part.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -transfer: to make server-side
	  copy/move operations when moving or copying messages on the same
	  IMAPStore.


2003-05-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small bug in the previous commit.
	* Updated the TODO. LOOK AT IT!!!
	* Added a patch from Rob Burns to fix the strings/encodings
	  in Localizable.strings files.
	

2003-05-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -_initializeIMAPStoreWithAccountName
	  to correctly remove the wrong password from the cache if the auth failed.
	  We now use GNUMail+TaskManager: -authenticationFailedForServer: ...
	  to do so.
	* Permuted the Delete/Cancel buttton in the alert panel when deleting a mailbox.
	* Permuted the Compact/Cancel button in the alert panel when compacting a mailbox.


2003-05-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a new options in the Viewing panel. We now allow to do "nothing"
	  (except displaying the message) when double-clicking on a message in
	  MailWindow.
	* Updated ViewingView.nib for the previous commit

 
2003-04-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -{start/stop}Animation to
 	  return immediately when the toolbar customization sheet is shown. 
	* Added MailWindowController: -toolbarDidRemoveItem (on OS X only)
	  to correctly set our get ivar to nil if the button gets removed.


2003-04-28     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modifed GNUMail: -deleteOrUndeleteMessage to set the right
	  key equivalent value when changing the label.
	* Fixed the autoresizing mask of the sizeLabel in EditWindow.nib.
	* Added a new option in the Advanced pref panel:
	  "Prompt before compacting a mailbox" (PROMPT_BEFORE_COMPACT) so
	  it's possible to tell GNUMail.app to not ask the user to confirm
	  the compact operation everything he/she executes it.
	* Updated AdvancedView.nib to reflect the changes in the
	  previous commit.


2003-04-27     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController to hide the "Local" folder node if
	  we have no local mailboxes. Same thing in Utilities (for the folder node
	  popup buttons)
	* Fixed a bug in Utilities: +folderNodesFromFolders: separator: to be sure
	  that the child doesn't exist before adding it to its parent.
	* Fixed a bug in PGPController: - _decryptPart: ... We no longer use a pipe
	  when decrypting signed messages but rather read everything from a file
	  like it's the case for encrypted messages. This prevents from filling up
	  the pipe with big messages - thus blocking the whole GNUMail process.


2003-04-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified AccountEditorWindowController to ease the selection of the
	  SMTP AUTH mechanism.
	* Set the initial first responder in NewMailboxPanel, set the next key views
	  (and corrected the ones in PasswordPanel) and added the "Enter" key support
	  under GNUstep.
	* Set the OS X's version number to 1.1.0.
	* Added GNUMail+Extensions: -removeTemporaryFiles to clean up all temporary
	  files created by GNUMail during its execution.
	* Permuted the releases of the AddressBook/AddressBookController singletons
	  in applicationShouldTerminate to prevent a segfault on exit on OS X.
	* Refactored TextEnrichedConsumer - made a NSAttributedString category instead
	  of its own class.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -_updateViewWithMessage: ... to set the attributed
	  string to the text storage instead of adding it. This prevents from having a
	  signature when restoring a message from the drafts folder.
	* Modified the OS X project file for the changes in the previous commit
	* Set the activeButton to NSOnState in FilterEditorWindowController: -setFilter:
	  when adding a new filter.
	* Improvements over the first commit


2003-04-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -newMessagesWereReceived to set the
	  app icon when we receive new mails using IMAP. That will be changed later
	  when we finish the IMAP rewrite.
	* Modified AccountEditorWindowController: -sendSupportedMechanismsButtonClicked to
	  use SSL if it needs to!


2003-04-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified AccountEditorWindow.nib to cleanup some things in it.
	* Modified Utilities: +folderNodePopUpItemForURLNameAsString: ...
	  to add an "account" parameter since we can't guess an account if
	  we are currently adding it or if we changed its type (from POP3 to
	  IMAP). Also fixed the code in AccountEditorWindowController to correctly
	  behaves when adding a new IMAP account.
	* Set the version number to 1.1.0 under GNUstep (GNUMailInfo.plist)
	* Modified AddressBook to define +singleInstance like all other singletons
	  and modified all the code to use that.
	* Added the AddressBook class to ScriptingInfo.plist


2003-04-21     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified FilterManager: -_messageFromExternalProgramUsingFilter: message:
	  to gradually read the data from the pipe - it seems to cause problems under
	  OS X if we do not do so.
        * Set the CVS tag to v1_1_0pre2
        * RELEASED VERSION 1.1.0pre2

 
2003-04-20      Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Reduced the indentation width in the MailboxManager view 
	  on OS X.


2003-04-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -transfer: to properly copy
	  the Message's flags when moving mails to an other mailbox.
	* We now offer a "Refresh" button in the Mailboxes panel to
	  immediately refresh the list of subscribed mailboxes and also
	  subscribed (if needed) the the INBOX folder (when using IMAP).
	  The nib needs to be updated under OS X.
	* Updated the OS X nib.
	* Fixed FilterHeaderEditorWindow.nib
	* Modified FilterEditorWindowController: -okClicked: to trim the
	  trailing whitespaces of the external program text field.


2003-04-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We are now sure that we properly send the flags to the IMAP
	  server when we have to. Also fixed two small memory leaks.
	* Modified Task/EditWindowController/BounceWindowController/Utilities
	  so that we now consider properly the selection of the transport
	  method when sending a mail.
	* Updated the README
	* Enhanced IMAPView under GNUstep
	* We now show the "right" label for the Inbox folder (when using IMAP)
	* Updated the OS X files wrt the previous commit.


2003-04-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

 	* We don't include the trailing > in URL:s highlighting.
	* We beep if the user has specified an empty find string
	  and clicked on the Find All button.
	* Modified MailWindow.nib to use Apple's NSProgressIndicator.
	  It's now way nicer.
	* Did the same thing for ConsoleWindow.
       

2003-04-14     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the "Enter" key support in the Password Panel.
	  (TODO #270)


2003-04-13     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a typo in the previous commit.
	* Set the next key views under GNUstep for all 
	  Account's window tab views.


2003-04-12     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Implemented TODO #266: When sending a message from 
	  the drafts folder, we mark the message deleted after we send it. 
	  Also, when we edit a message in the drafts folder and save 
	  it back in the drafts, the original message is marked deleted.


2003-04-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified NewMailboxPanelController so that we correctly
	  verify the exception name before assuming we lost our
	  connection to the IMAP server.


2003-04-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Disabled ExtendedTextView: -updateCursorLinks since
	  this method needs to be optimized or entirely rewritten.
	* Enabled the spinning icon when _sending_ mail in the MailWindow:s
	  and removed/refactored some code.
 

2003-04-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified AccountEditorWindowController: -dealloc
	  to be sure that the store's TCP connection is valid
	  before attempting to issue a store operation.


2003-04-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed Foundation/NSDistributedNotificationCenter.h from
	  TaskManager's include list.


2003-04-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in ReceivingViewController: -saveChanges.
	  We were using showNoNewMessagesPanelButton instead of
	  showFilterPanelButton for SHOW_FILTER_PANEL.
	* We now verify the termination status in FilterManager:
	  -_messageFromExternalProgramUsingFilter: message: to correctly
	  handle errors.
	* Fixed the ReceivingView.m UI so it looks like the one on OS X.
	* Removed MailboxManagerController: -passwordForKey (we are now
	  only using the method defined in Utilities).
	* Removed Utilites: +replyToAll: folder: and merged the logic	
	  in +replyToSender: folder: replyToAll: Modified the code to use
	  this modified method.
	* Simplified the code in Utilities: +loadAccountsInPopUpButton: select:
	* Minor refactorings in Utilities.
	* Removed everything released to the messageWasSent ivar in 
	  EditWindowController and did some minor refactorings.


2003-04-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a patch from Stefan Urbanek to improve the 
	  labels used in the information/alert panels.
	* We now correctly close the IMAP store that we might
	  have opened when listing subscribed folders in
	  AccountEditorWindowController.
	* Modified the message display code and the URL highlighting
	  code. The baby is now _FAST_. It's currently not entirely
	  optimized on GNUstep since the text network is borken.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -_selectionDidChange to
	  verify the exception name before assuming we lost the
	  connection to the IMAP store.
	* Moved the code from MailWindowController: -tableViewColumnDidResize
	  to -windowWillClose since this code isn't working under GNUstep because 
	  the NSTableViewColumnDidResizeNotification is posted when 
	  initializing the instance and we automatically overwrite the values
	  previous saved in the defaults. We now save the values only when
	  closing the window. 
	* Updated BounceWindow.nib - it was broken.


2003-04-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the NSString+Extensions category. We now
	  use the one in Pantomime instead. Modified all the files
	  depending on that removed category.
	* Removed all the code depending on the distributed notification
	  center.
	* Updated the OS X project file
	* Fixed an include bug in PGPController.m


2003-03-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set GNUMail+TaskManager: -messageWas{Received/Sent}: forURLName:
          as oneway methods.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -_openIMAPFolderWithName: store: sender:
	  so that if we are trying to reopen the opened IMAP folder, we simply make
	  its 'associated window' the key one and we order it front.
	* Optimized things so we don't synchronize the MailboxManagerCache each time
	  we display a message. This seems to noticeably reduce the message's display
	  delay.
 

2003-03-29     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in my previous commit (FontsViewController)
	* Modified GNUMail: -updateGetNewMailMenuItem: to only use
	  enabled accounts. 
	* We now correctly reload the font in the message list if 
	  those values have changed.


2003-03-28     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed MailWindowToolbar to return nil if the navigation toolbar
	  item is 'found'. That would prevent a segfault for users moving
	  from 1.1.0pre1 to 1.1.0pre2 that had customized their MailWindow
	  toolbar.
	* Added a new preference value: MESSAGE_LIST_FONT_{NAME, SIZE}. It's now
	  possible to set this pref value in order to use a 'custom' font in the
	  MailWindow message list. I'll modify the Font nib right now.
	* Updated FontsView.nib for the previous commit. You must restart the app
	  right now if you want the font changes in the message list to take
	  effect.


2003-03-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified all GNUmakefile:s to add -Wno-import
	* Added scripting support using StepTalk. Patch from
	  Stefan Urbanek <urbanek@host.sk>.


2003-03-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a patch from Tomio Arisaka <tomio-a@max.hi-ho.ne.jp> to
	  fix some issues in the PGP bundle. It's now also possible to
	  always use the Multipart PGP style when sending messages.
	* Modified PGPView.nib for the previous commit.
	* Fixed a bug in MailboxManagerController: -_openIMAPFolderWithName: store: sender:.


2003-03-23  Mirko Viviani  <mirko@objectlab.org>

	* GNUMail+TaskManager.m ([GNUMail -nextTask]): discard already running
	tasks.


2003-03-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the printing code under OS X.
	* We now _really_ prevent more than one folder to be opened on the
	  same IMAP store.
	* Modified the GNUmakefile so we can easily test GNUMail.app with
 	  Electric Fence.
	* Modified Utilties and GNUMail+TaskManager (-tick) so that we now release
	  the content of the message that have 'expired'. Currently set to 300 seconds,
	  it can be changed in Constants. This prevents GNUMail from using and using
	  memory even if some messages haven't been re-read (after beeing first
	  initialized) over the same session.


2003-03-21     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removing the generation of debug symbols for the Receiving,
	  Face and Advanced targets on OS X.
	* Fixed some nib issues regarding the icons.
	* Made some UI improvements to the PreferencesWindow.nib
	* Added a "Save in Drafts" option in the Console to save a message
	  in the queue to the Drafts folder of the proper account.
	* Modified ConsoleWindow.nib
 

2003-03-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Made use of the localization macro for all toolbar labels
	  (or title and tooltips). The localization files haven't been
	  yet created.
	* Fixed the OS X version number (set to 1.0.99)
        

2003-03-20  Mirko Viviani  <mirko@objectlab.org>

	* NSUserDefaults+Extensions.m ([NSUserDefaults -colorForKey:theKey]):
	check for assigned values.


2003-03-19     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed (but not yet tested) in Utilities: +passwordForKey: type: prompt:
	  related to SMTP auth support.


2003-03-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in Utilites: +loadTransportMethodsInPopUpButton where
	  we were wrongly adding items to our popup buttons.
	* Refactored some code to use the +allEnabledAccounts method from
	  Utilities.
 

2003-03-16     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Added support for attachment in scripting. Syntax is:
	    tell mymail
		attach file "filename"
	    end tell
	    
	    or 
	    
	    attach mymail file "filename"
	    
	    where mymail is a reference to a message composition 
	    and filename is the file to be attached.


2003-03-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small issue in the previous commit (-restoreDraft)
	  that would prevent the code to be compiled on gcc < 3.x
	* Fixed the OS X project file since the framework installation path
	  was fixed in the Pantomime project file.
	* Fixed missing action connections in ReceivingView.nib
	* Modified EditWindowController/BounceWindowController to use the
	  new method in Utilities (allEnabledAccounts) to verify if we can
	  use these controllers.
	* Fixed an outlet connection problem in AccountEditorWindow regarding
	  the Send tab.
	* Modified the Compose pref bundle to correctly load the default charsets.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -_replaceSignature to correctly verify
	  if the textView's font isn't nil before adding it to a dictionary. That
	  would fail under OS X.
	* Enhanced the UI of most preferences bundles.
	* Fixed a bug in AccountEditorWindowController that was involving a
	  non-mutable dictionary.


2003-03-15     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Fixed bug in Utilities: +loadAccountsInPopUpButton: select:.
	
	* Fixed bug in GNUMail: -restoreDraft. Message was not 
	  being initialized.


2003-03-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the code that was replacing the signature in EditWindowController.
	  The previous code wasn't working if the source was a program's output.
	* Refactored all the code in Utilities (and EditWindowController) so that
	  we now select the right account when replying/forwarding a mail. Also
	  fixed some bugs in the previous code that would prevent the right account
	  (or before, profile) to be selected.

	* Foundation/NSScriptObjectSpecifiers.h is not needed 
	  in EditWindowController anymore since it will not be 
	  directly scripted.
	  
	* Implemented "send" script command handler in MessageComposer. 
	  We can now script GNUMail!!

	* Small change in the previous commit to NOT import
	  Foundation/NSScriptObjectSpecifiers.h under GNUstep.


2003-03-14     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Created MessageComposition class that can be scripted.

	* One step closer to scripting nirvana...
	

2003-03-10     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Experimental code for expanding Applescript support. 
	  Still incomplete.
	  
	* Fixed a confounding bug in the Account Editor NIB file 
	  where the sendUsingSecureConnection was wired to the 
	  wrong object. Had completely incapacitated sending mail.


2003-03-09     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Fixed a bug in the Face bundle. We now correctly release the
	  Face views used in MailWindow objects.
	* Corrected some window reordering in most bundles (Account,
	  MIME and Filtering) ie., where the issues were.
	* Fixed some bugs with account names handling in MailboxManagerController.
	  We weren't getting correctly the 'root' node for an account when using
	  IMAP stores.
	* Added a new constant (OTHER) and cleaned some code to use it.
	* Added MailHeaderCell.h to the OS X project file and made consistency changes
	  to the project file regarding public headers for the GNUMail framework.


2003-03-06     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Updated PB project file to reflect latest file changes.


2003-03-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in EditWindowController so that we correctly replace
	  the signature if the account changes. Also refactored a little
	  bit _replaceSignature so that we set the insertion pointer at the
	  beginning of the textview and removed some unneccesary code to
	  get the proper font.


2003-03-05     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Updated PB project file to reflect latest file changes.
	

2003-03-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed two small issues so the source would cleanly compile
	  with gcc < 3.x.
	* Moved ChangeLog to ChangeLog.1 and created a new file.
	* Removed GNUMailConstants.m
	* Renamed GNUMailConstants.h to Constants.h and modified all files
	  to use it. Also cleaned the file since it was a pure mess before.
	  The OS X project file needs to be modified to reflect those changes.
	* Added sort_right.tiff. The OS X project file must be modified to be 
	  sure it contains sort_right and sort_down.
	* Modified MailWindowController (and ExtendedOutlineView) to use the
	  sort_right and sort_down tiff files when using messages threading.
