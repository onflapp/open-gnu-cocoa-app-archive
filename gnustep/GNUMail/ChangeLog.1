2003-03-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Optimized Utilities: +_quoteMessageContentFromAttributedString:
	  We now cache the values obtained with -colorForKey:.
	* Added support for automatic checking for new mails. It honors the
	  retreive interval for each account. GNUstep users might experience
	  the following exception:
 	  Uncaught exception NSLockException, reason: Thread attempted to recursively lock
	  This seems to be a bug in GNUstep base.
	* Removed the ShouldCloseMailbox constant and the observer in MailWindowController.
	  Also modified GNUMail: -applicationShouldTerminate to class -close on all
	  opened MailWindow:s.
	

2003-03-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the installation dir of the Clock bundle. Bug reported
	  by Stefan Urbanek <urbanek@host.sk>.
	* We now honor the "Enabled" account parameter and we also reload
	  the folders in the Mailboxes window properly if accounts have 
	  changed.
	* Resized the buttons in NewMailboxPanel.m.
	* Modified FaceController to ignore the case for the 
	  "X-Image-URL" header key.
	* Modified NewMailboxPanelController to correctly rename the IMAP
	  cache file and also to update all "MAILBOXES" account informations
	  when renaming a folder.
	* Fixed to _very_ annoying compiler warnings in TaskManager. Replaced
  	  [NSDate date] by AUTORELEASE([[NSDate alloc] init]).
	* Modified Utilities: +loadAccountsInPopUpButton: select: and 
	  +loadTransportMethodsInPopUpButton: to NOT load informations from
	  disabled accounts.
	* Removed EditWindowController: -_loadTranportMethods.
	* Did the same thing in BounceWindowController.
	* Added a patch from Matt Rice to support DnD files in EditWindow
	  from, say, GWorkspace (this was already working on OS X).


2003-03-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Removed the Previous/Next buttons in the MailWindow
	  under GNUstep.
	* Fixed a mem leak in Utilities: +formattedAttributedStringFromAttributedString:
	* Modified MailWindowController: -setFolder to no longer show the
	  "No message in this folder" alert panel. This was annoying for no
	  good reason.
	* Modified Utilities (Private): _attributedStringFromTextForPart: to handle
	  encodings in a cleaner way. This needs optimizations, though.
	* Added a NSStepper for the "minutes" field in ReceivingExpertView.
	* Fixed memory leaks.
	* Implemented sound notifications in the filtering code. Modified Filter,
	  FilterManager and all the views used to edit the filters.
	* Optimized the "highlighting" of URLs (modified ExtendedTextView
	  to not do a loc++).
	* It's now possible to specify a default sound when receiving new mails
	  in the Sending pref panel.
	* Rewrote near all the preferences code. We now have a brand new preferences
	  panel (and modules) and the concept of "accounts".
	* Added more code to GNUMail+Extensions: -update_1098_to_1099 to migrate
	  from the old prefs to the new ones.
	* Modified GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching so that we now use
	  ~/Mailboxes instead of ~/gnumail to store the mailboxes under GNUstep.
	* Moved the matching of the Outbox folder in the thread so it is a little
	  faster to send mails.
	* Moved FilteringTableView out of the Filtering bundle (same with the 
	  ExtendedTableColumn) and renamed SwitchTableColumn. We now also use it in the
	  Account bundle.
	* We now explicitly set the border type of all scrollviews to NSBezelBorder
	* Removed the Size column in the MailboxManager and all the code "depending"
	  on it.
	* Fixed a bug in AddressBookController: -modifyAddress: We don't always assume
	  we got at least one address. Same with -ccClicked: and -bccClicked: 
	* Removed MailboxManagerController: _messageFromLocalDraftsFolderUsingURLName:
	  and _messageFromIMAPDraftsFolderUsingURLName: since we are now "forcing"
	  the user to open the drafts folder before chosing the "restore" operation.
	* Removed the code to migrate from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3.
	* Removed the -lockFocus/-unlockFocus class in ExtendedAttachmentCell and
	  MailHeaderCell. This fixes rendering artifacts under GNUstep and well, 
	  optimize a little bit things.
	* Removed the Size column from MailboxWindow.nib
	* Added the missing nibs for the new Preferences panel.
	* We no longer show the nb. of message/unread messages when we have
	  a folder - just for mailboxes.
	* Re-imported all the sources on the CVS. Everybody MUST completely
	  checkout the application.
	* Fixed a small issue with AccountView nib (now make uses of the custom
	  class ExtendedTableColumn)
	* Set the right tags for the matrix in ViewingView.nib
	* Converted MIMEView.nib to the new nib format and added a description
	  at the top of the view like other panels.
	* Also added a description to the Filter panel.
	* Removed the code in EditWindow to connect the outlets and modified
	  the controller to connect the outlet directly to the ivars under
	  GNUstep.
	* Done the same thing for MailWindow and its controller.
	* Modified AccountViewController: -dealloc to set the data source to
	  nil under OS X.
	* Done the same thing in AccountEditorWindowController for imapOutlineView.
	* Added the "Sound" UI elements in the FilterEditorWindow.nib and converted
	  to the new nib format. Also converted to the new nib format
	  FilterHeaderEditorWindow.nib and FilterMessageWindow.nib
	* Set the data source to nil in FilterHeaderEditorWindowController: -dealloc.
	* Modified FilterEditorWindow.m to correctly set the scroll view border
	  to NSBezelBorder under GNUstep.
	* Minor UI adjustments in AboutPanel.m for the new GNUstep text engine.
	* Modified AccountView.nib to make the columns non-editable.
	* Modified PasswordPanelController to include awakeFromNib to set the 
	  initial first responder to the password secure field. Patch from
	  Tomio Arisaka <tomio-a@max.hi-ho.ne.jp>.
	* Modified MessageViewWindow for the outlet code (and its controller)
	  and to set the border type of the scroll view.
	* Did the same thing with PasswordPanel and its controller.
	* Did the same thing with ConsoleWindow and its controller.
	* Did the same thing with NewMailboxPanel and its controller.
	* Cleaned some code in MailWindowController
	* Modified GNUMail+TaskManager and TaskManager so that we correctly
	  stop our TaskManager. This prevents random segfault when quitting
	  the application.
	* Added a COLOR_QUOTED_TEXT key so that we can activate or desactivate
	  the coloring of quoted text. Modified Utilities: +_quoteMessageContentFromAttributedString
	  to use it. Implemented all the behavior of the Colors preferences panel.
	* Updated the ColorsView.nib
	* Modified MailWindowToolbar.m to remove the "navigation" option. This is useless
 	  in this window.
	* Removed some done TODO items.
	

2003-02-17     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Fixed another small problem in my previous commit.
	  Was referencing the wrong size when setting the 
	  width of the the size column.
	  
	* Fixed bugs in validating toolbar items in 
          MailboxManagerToolbar.m
	  

2003-02-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca> 

        * Fixed a small bug in the previous commit. columnSizes was never
	  nil even if the pref (MAIL_WINDOW_TABLE_COLUMN_SIZES) didn't exist
	  (at least, under GNUstep) so we would get index out of bounds
	  exception.
 

2003-02-16     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Put in a workaround for a problem with using autosave feature on 
	  the NSTableView in MailWindow. The autosave was being used for 
	  saving column sizes, but it was messing with the dynamic addition 
	  and removal of columns. Now we do not use the autosave feature 
	  and explicitly save the column sizes.
	  
	* Fixed a problem in Viewing Preference nib file where the 
	  Status column checkbox was always selected regardless of the 
	  value in the saved preferences.
	  

2003-02-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: +flattenPathFromString: separator: so that
	  if no separator was specified (nil), we use a default one (/).
	* Modified AboutPanel.m so the imageView isn't editable.


2003-02-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Minor fix in EditWindowController: -textDidChange to not
 	  use -string on the textStorage. It should also make things
	  faster.
	* Fixed a bug in AddressBookController: -toClicked: We are now
	  correctly verifying that we have at least one address in a
	  group when double-clicking on an address in the AddressBookWindow.
	* Modified MailWindowController to not draw the cell's background
	  color if it's selected so that coloring filters don't interfere
	  with the current row selection.


2003-02-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Done TODO #216. We now offer an option (OPEN_MAILBOX_AFTER_TRANSFER)
	  to automatically open folders in which messages were transferred
	  by filters after reception of those messages.
	* Modified the Receiving bundle so it's possible to graphically
	  set this option. The ReceivingExpertView.nib needs to be updated.

	
2003-02-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the "Close" buttons from AddressBookWindow and MailboxManager
	  under GNUstep.
	* Fixed a bug in FilterManager. We weren't returning URLName objects 
	  as we should be in case of errors.
	* Updated MailboxesView.nib to remove the "reuse MailWindow.." checkbox.
	* Added the "Open in new Window" item to the Mailboxes menu
	* Added the keyed archived for both nibs (MailboxesView.nib and MainMenu.nib)


2003-02-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the "All Mailboxes" item from the MailboxManager
	  and updated all the code to reflect that change.


2003-02-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Made things a little bit faster when scrolling in the MailWindow (in
	  the dataview)
	* If we use a fixed-pitch font when composing emails, we now show in the
	  size label how many characters there is on a single line (the maximum).
	* Fixed a bug in the MailboxManagerController - we weren't asking to close
	  the IMAP store when collapsing an IMAP node.


2003-02-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now expand the outline view nodes of the stores
	  of folders opened on startup.
	* Refactored a lot of code, especially in the MailboxManagerController.
	  We now correctly close IMAP connection if the store wasn't open
	  and we added a message to the Outbox folder. Removed some NSLog
	  calls, move some code from Utilites to MailboxManagerController
	  and move some code in MailboxManagerController to the private
	  category.
	* Refactored more code in the MailboxManagerController.
	* Implemented -mode/-setMode in all bundles to keep the compiler
	  quiet. Users _will have_ to update their PGP bundle.
	* Changed the BUNDLE_INSTALL_DIR from GNUSTEP_USER_ROOT to
	  GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR for the Face, PGP, and Clock bundles. 


2003-02-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail: -changeTextEncoding: to set the new headers
	  of the selected message that have been decoded with the new
	  charset and we now refresh the selected row properly. With the
	  modifications in Pantomime, this completes TODO #294 and #327.
	* Ajusted -changeTextEncoding: for refactorings made in Pantomime.
	* Done TODO #264. Changed import calls for include and guarded
	  all headers against multiple inclusion.


2003-01-31     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the concept of "reusing the MailWindow". Added
	  a menu item in the Mailbox menu "Open in new window" so
	  it opens the selected mailbox in the MailboxManager in
	  a separate window.
	  The nibs need to be updated (add the menu item and remove
	  the checkbox in Mailboxes.nib)
	* Added a dock menu on OS X. Suggestion from Hasan Diwan 
	  <hdiwan@mac.com>.
	* Updated the MainMenu.nib and the MailboxesView.nib for
	  the initial commit.


2003-01-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindowController: -initWithWindowNibName
	  to use the MESSAGE_FONT_{NAME,SIZE} when composing mail
	  and not using a fixed-pitch font.
	* Added Czech translation from Petr Malat <petris@penguin.cz>.


2003-01-26     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added dynamic resizing of preferences modules views
	  under OS X. Most preferences modules nibs have been
	  improved.


2003-01-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in ComposeViewController (Private):
	  _updateFromValues. The popup selection wasn't
	  restored correctly.
	* Did some minor indentation fixes in GNUMail.m
	* Fixed the DOWNLOAD_URL constant in GNUMail.m since
	  it has changed (with the new, updated, website).
	* Implemented -copyWithZone in ExtendedCell and removed
	  the FIXME on OS X in -dealloc.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -setFolder to not show
	  the "There are no messages in this Mailbox!" message if
	  the user has chosen to not show the "Show No New Messages
	  panel" in the receiving option.
	* Modified ReceivingExpertView to rename the checkbutton to
	  "Show No new messages / No messages in this mailbox alert panel" 
	  The nib needs to be updated.
	* Modified the box title of ReceivingExpertView to use "UNIX accounts.."
	  instead of "local mail spool..."
	* Updated the nibs.


2003-01-25	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Added Applescript support on OS X to handle 
	  "mailto:" URLs. Support can be expanded to 
	  do other cool stuff.
	  
	* Fixed a few bugs related to status indication and message 
	  selection after deletion that were being caused by the 
	  NO_MESSAGE_RENDER_IN_MAIL_WINDOW preference being set.


2003-01-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added openFolder and closedFolder to the repository
 	  and the OS X project file.
	* Implemented -outlineView: willDisplayOutlineCell: ...
	  in MailboxManagerController to set the custom icon.
	* Modified ExtendedOutlineView so that it behaves like
	  on OS X (uses the small "folder icons").
	

2003-01-22     Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* ExtendedOutlineView.m: move boxes icon to the left.
	* Icons/mailboxes_16.tiff: no more shadow, translation to the left


2003-01-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -_stringValueOfURLNameFromItem: store:
	  to include the username for an IMAP folder.


2003-01-21     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small bug in TaskManager: -_sendUsingSendmailForTask:
	  (we weren't using the data value when calling -messageWasSent:)
	* Added the ImageTextCell class for both GNUstep/OS X (need to
	  add it to the OS X project file) to be used in the 
	  MailboxManagerController's window.
	* Added the new ImageTextCell class to the OS X's project file.


2003-01-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the version number to 1.0.99
	* Done TODO #335 and added some custom icons to be shown
	  in the MailboxManager for 'default' folders.
	* Updated the OS X project file to include those new
 	  icons and fixed a small bug in the previous commit
	* Fixed a small bug in NewMailboxManagerController: -okClicked.
	  We weren't returning elegantly from the exception handler
	  (with NS_VOIDRETURN)


2003-01-20	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Added a hidden option NO_MESSAGE_RENDER_IN_MAIL_WINDOW 
	  to disable rendering of messages in the split view of the 
	  main mail window. This is an performance optimization for 
	  people who prefer to read mail in a separate window by 
	  double-clicking on the message in the table view.

	
2003-01-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Moved the code to create the table columns from MailWindow
          to MailWindowController. We also use those table columns under
          OS X now (instead of the ones coming from the nib).
	* We now no longer generate debug symbols for the GNUMail framework
	  target on OS X.
	* Modified some min/current width on OS X for the table columns.
        * Tagged the cvs to v1_1_0pre1.
        * RELEASE VERSION 1.1.0pre1.


2003-01-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Reactivated the memory panel under GNUstep
	  (Info->Memory Panel...)
	* We now correctly release our LocalMailDelivery object
	  in TaskManager: -_receiveUsingUNIXForTask:.


2003-01-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the Clock bundle from the top-level GNUmakefile.


2003-01-13     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the docs/README file in preparation for the
          release.


2003-01-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Commented the code in ConsoleWindowController:
          -messageWasReceived since it's currently not
          used anymore and we were reloading the tableView's
          content for no reason everytime we got a
          GNUMailConsoleMessage distributed notification.
	* Reactivated the GNUMailConsoleMessage support in the
	  console. The OS X nib needs to be updated.
	* Updated ConsoleWindow.nib
	* Added a method defintion in Face.h to prevent a compiler
	  warning.


2003-01-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified PGPController so we correctly verify the
          launch path (if it exists and if it is executable)
          of the gnupg binary.
        

2003-01-11	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Fixed a bug where hitting enter on a highlighted message 
	  would not emulate a double click action.
	  
	* Making table view first repsonder in MailWindow so that 
	  up and down arrows work without having to click in the 
	  table view.
	  
	* Opening Mailbox Manager and Console, if desired, before 
	  opening the folders so that the last opened folder window 
	  is active instead of the Mailbox Manager or Console windows.
	  

2003-01-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now correctly release the previous loaded nib
          for all pref bundles (some were not correct, like
          the Fonts, Receiving and Compose bundles).
	* We now set the animation ivar to nil in MailWindowController:
	  -initWithWindowNibName.
	* Modified ConsoleWindowController and MailWindowController to
	  verify in -_noTaskInQueueIsRunning for not only running tasks
	  but for tasks that have the flag 'immediate' set to YES since
	  even if those aren't running, they are next to be fun immediately.
	* Optimized GNUMail+TaskManager: -messageWasSent so we don't use
	  the data value of the message to get the URLName object but we rather
	  use the Message's instance directly (faster).
	* Changed GNUMail+TaskManager: -messageWasSent so we accept directly the
	  message as RAW source. This prevents us from calling -dataValue on the
	  Message object twice. Modified TaskManager to use the modified method.
	  This should speed up things when sending mails.


2003-01-10	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Fixed a bug in saving changes when Preferences were 
	  launched under Expert mode. Bug affected Receiving, 
	  Compose, and Fonts bundles.
	  
	
2003-01-09     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in the TextEnrichedConsumer.


2003-01-09     Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* Removed setContainerSize calls from EditWindowController.m


2003-01-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindowController: -initWithWindowNibName to
          set the font of the text view to a fixed pitch if the user
          is using a fixed pitch font for plain/text messages.


2003-01-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added some TODO items
	* Modified PGPViewController: -initializeFromDefaults so that under OS X
	  we set the gpg's path field to /usr/local/bin/gpg instead of
	  /usr/bin/gpg.
	* Modified MailWindowController: _restoreSortingOrder so that we don't run
	  into problems since our Id -> # change for the sorting order saved in
	  the user defaults. It was causing a UI weirdness under GNUstep and the
	  user had to sort again by clicking on a table column.


2003-01-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching so
          that we warn the user if the creation of the GNUMailUserLibraryPath
          failed using NSRunCriticalAlertPanel instead of NSDebugLog.
	* Improved GNUMail (Extensions): -moveLocalMailDirectoryFromPath: toPath:
	  so that if the directory already exists, we simply move the files
	  in it and we remove the old directory. Also added some error handling
	  code.
	* Set the version number under OS X to 1.0.98 (which is 1.1.0pre1).
	* Updated the AboutPanel.nib to include "2003".
	* Modified TaskManager to update the status label when ignoring downloaded
	  messages in POP3. Also modified MailWindowController to return
	  immediately in -updateStatusLabel when the animation is running.
	* Modified AddressBook: -addressesWithPrefix: so that under OS X (using the
 	  OS X 10.2 AB), we don't set the Last Name if it isn't defined.


2003-01-04	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

        * Apple's AddressBook is default on MacOS X.


2003-01-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the code to NOT use the TRANSFERRED flag
          anymore. We now only use the DELETED flag.
	* Modified some code so that we don't add the DELETED/ANSWERED
	  flags directory to the Message's Flags object but we rather
	  copy the flags, add it and set the flags back to the Message
	  (so that IMAPMessage: -setFlags: can be called).


2003-01-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Recreated entirely the OS X project file. Now, one just
	  has to copy the Pantomime.framework into the build dir
	  and compile the GNUMail target. Everything will be compiled
	  and bundles will be installed. Need to update the project file
	  to include the PGP, Face and Clock bundles.
	* Changed all occurrences of MACOSX102 to MACOSX
	* Removed dylibfix.c
	* Updated the bundle loading code in PreferencesWindowController
	  since they are now in PlugIns (standard OS X location)
 	* Added GNUMail_main.m and moved the main function from
	  GNUMail to this new file.	
	* Added GNUMail_main.m to the GNUmakefile
	* Disabled the Help menu under OS X since we don't have any
	  help right now.
	* Added the PGP target to the OS X project file.
	* Added the Face target to the OS X project file.
	* Changed the Id column to #.
	* Changed the Id column to # (and the identifier) in MailWindow.nib
	* Updated the OS X project file versions to 1.1.0pre1
	* Improved EditWindowController: -textDidChange so we don't try
	  to do anything if our text storage's length is smaller than 1.
		

2003-01-03	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

        * Removed dependencies on GNUmail.framework and dylibfix from 
          all targets in PB file. Both to be soon obsoleted.
          

2003-01-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified TaskManager: -_sendUsingSMTPForTask: to reschedule
          the task (+5 mins) if an error occurred when sending the mail,
          not only when the user has pressed the Stop button. Also modified
          _sendUsingSendmailForTask to reschedule the task in case of
          an error.
	* Set the version to 1.0.98 (1.1.0 pre1)
	* Removed the GNUMail-10.2 OS X project file and set the version
	  to 1.0.98 under OS X.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController so that under OS X, we don't set the
	  children to nil on the collapsing folder node.
	* Removed docs/WHATSNEW.SPENCER and docs/INSTALL.SPENCER.


2002-12-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small bug due to the previous commit. The Find submenu
          was set to the Undo menu item under GNUstep.
	* Added EditWindowController: -_updatePart: usingTextAttachment:
	  and refactored -updateMessageContentFromTextView to use it. Also
	  added support for sending message with only one attachment (no
	  textual parts).


2002-12-30	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

        * Added "Paste As Quoted Text" option under the Edit menu.
          Needs to be added to other non-English nibs and tested 
          under GNUstep.
          

2002-12-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added all (hopefully) IMAP disconnection handling code.
	* Fixed some errors in the previous commit.


2002-12-29     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactored TaskManager: -_transferMessagesFromPOP3Folder: task:
          to use the new POP3Folder: -prefetchMessageAtIndex method. We
          now deal ourself with the POP3CacheManager.


2002-12-28     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added missing files to the OS X project file.
	* Modified MainMenu.nib to add Sorting->Thread Messages.

	  to -setDataViewType.
	* Modified the code that was using -dataUsingSendingMode of
	  Part/Message (Pantomime classes) to use -dataValue.
	* Modified the PGPBundle so we now use -setProperty: forKey: instead
	  of -setExtraProperty: forKey: from Pantomime's Message class.


2002-12-27     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Enhanced MailWindowController: -_objectValueForTableColumn:
          message: item: to deal better with nil From/To/Date/Subject
          in Messages (just to be safer).


2002-12-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the RELEASE(filterManager); in 
          FilteringViewController: -dealloc.
	* Modified GNUMail: -applicationShouldTerminate to
	  correctly release our FilterManager and MimeTypeManager
	  singletons.

	  when displaying attachements (always as icons or we try to display
	  it, if possible).
	* Implemented the selection of indexes in the dataView when using
	  message threading and doing a find operation.
	* Added more TODOs.


2002-12-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the MimeType management code to eliminate
          the "needs terminal" option and to add an "Open with
          Workspace" feature. This completes TODO #304.

	  so that we now use a singleton.


2002-12-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

          in GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching in this new
          category.
        * Done TODO #281. Doing a:
          defaults write GNUMail LOCALMAILDIR /path/to/new/directory
          will now automatically create that directory, move all local
          mailboxes to this new location and update all 'dependencies'
          (like Filters, user's defaults, etc.).
        * Done TODO #329. We now put the mailboxes under Mac OS X
          in ~/Library/GNUMail/Mailboxes. NEEDS TESTING.
	* Renamed NSStringExtensions to NSString+Extensions.
	* Renamed NSUserDefaultsExtensions to NSUserDefaults+Extensions.
	* Modified Task/TaskManager/GNUMail+TaskManager so that we now
	  correctly inform the user if messages were received and transferred
	  to other folders by the filters.
	* Removed all the commented code in MailWindowController.
	* Modified Task/TaskManager/GNUMail+TaskManager so that we now
	  "beep" if we received new mails on startup or when the timer
	  fired the check for new mails operation.

        * Applied a patch from Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com> to
	  support quoting level coloration when "composing" E-Mails.
	  Slightly modified the patch.
	* Added a "hidden" preference value: OPEN_CONSOLE_ON_STARTUP so
	  it's now possible to automatically show the Console's window
	  upon GNUMail.app's startup. Documented in docs/PREFERENCES.
	  Modified GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching to use it.
	* Reactivated the check for new mails on startup feature under
	  GNUstep. It now won't fire automatically but 5 secs after
	  the app is started.


2002-12-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated GNUMail+TaskManager: -checkForNewMail: controller:
 	  since the -openedFoldersEnumerator method has changed in
	  IMAPStore.


2002-12-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added MailboxManagerController: -allStores to return
          the list of all opened Stores.

        * Modified some of the code to correclty handle IMAP 
          disconnections. Added MailboxManagerController:
          -connectionWasLostToIMAPStore: folder: to handle this.
	  More work needs to be done.
	* Done TODO #303. Added an home-brewed About panel.
	* Added AboutPanel.nib and modified OS X's project file
	  to include the new classes.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -deleteMessage to be sure
	  we aren't trying to show the 'next' message when the folder
	  count is 0 (for example, if we hide deleted mails and there's
	  only one in the mailbox).
	* Modified the code in TaskManager to correctly close SMTP connections
	  when the user has asked to stop the current transfer.


2002-12-15	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

        * Fixed bugs with opening attachments with external apps.
          Full path to app binary was not being specified. 
          Launching with Classic apps is not yet supported.
          

2002-12-14	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

        * Changed class of text view from NSTextView to 
          ExtendedTextView in the MailWindow and MessageViewWindow 
          NIBs to match the previous commit. Also setting the 
          editable flag to NO in code for these objects.
          
        * Added hand.tiff to the OS X project.
        
        * Overrode ExtendedTextView: -initWithFrame: and 
          -initWithFrame: textContainer to make sure that 
          the hand cursor is created for hyperlinks.
          
        * Set the delgate for the ExtendedTextView appropriately.

        * Applied a patch from Stefan Urbanek <urbanek@host.sk>

        * Made ConsoleWindow resizable under GNUstep.
	* We now also use SCROLLER_SIZE in EditWindow.
	* Modified EditWindowController (Private)
	  -_setPlainTextContentFromString: inPart: so that
	  we don't always assume a QP encoding. For example,
	  we use no encoding (ie., NONE) when we have a 
	  iso-2022-jp charset since it's a 7-bit encoding.
	  Patch by Tomio Arisaka <tomio-a@max.hi-ho.ne.jp>

        * Done TODO #283: Messages transferred to Outbox are marked

	* Fixed a wrong outlet connecint in MimeTypeEditorWindowController
	  under GNUstep.


2002-12-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

          now prompt the user before quitting the app if any
          "dirty" EditWindow:s are currently opened.

	* Modified TaskManager (Private): -_nextTask to use a local
	  autorelease pool.
	* Modified Utilities: +clickedOnCell: inRect: atIndex: sender:
	  (added sender) to fix the bug that when saving attachments from
	  the menu, it would use the MimeTypeManager instead of instantly
	  prompting for the save panel.
	* We now use NSAscendingSortIndicator/NSDescendingSortIndicator
	  under OS X instead of our own sort_{up,down) tiff.

	  update the status label of the MailWindowController after

          stop the animation immediately.
	* Set the default's width of the From column to 155 instead of
	  170.

2002-11-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the GNUMail+TaskManager category.
	* Added the ExtendedMenuItem class.
	* Refactored A LOT of code to use the new task

          there.
	* Modified GNUMailInfo.plist and GNUMailConstants.m to set
	  the version number to 1.1.0

2002-10-28     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed all the code related to the "secureConnectionIcon"
	  and we now show properly the icon in the "icon" image view
	  when we are using a SSL/IMAP connection. Rescaled
	  pgp-mail-small.tiff. The OS X nib (MailWindow.nib) needs to
	  be modified. 


2002-10-27     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Implemented all the standard/expert view logic in the following
          bundles:
          - Receiving

	  the SUBSCRIBED_FOLDERS value so we were loosing it each time we would
	  modify an account.


2002-10-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Moved striphtml() and ent() from the Utilities class

	* Updated the OS X 10.1 project file to remove all references
	  to the Mailcap stuff.
	* Implemented all the standard/expert view logic in the Compose
	  bundle. This should serve as a basis for other bundles (how things
	  should work).
	* Removed -expertView from the PreferencesModule interface since 
	  we should never use it.
	* Reworked a little bit the UI of ReceivingExpertView (under GNUstep,
	  to match OS X's look).

	* Refactored a little bit EditWindowController and removed
	  done TODO items.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController to prevent the user to
	  delete {INBOX,OUTBOX,DRAFTS,TRASH}FOLDERNAME. The user must
	  now change them before trying to delete them.


2002-10-19	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

    	* Fixed auto-completion of groups.
    	* Made PGP and Face bundles dependencies of "Everything" target.

2002-10-19     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now show all the parents of a child (their nodes)
          as bold when the child is marked as unread.
        * Modified some prefs and MailWindowController to send/receive
          notifications when pref values have changed. Refactored
          some code in MailWindowController.
	* Added #ifdef MACOSX102 around Jaguar's AB code
	* Overwrited the project file so it works on 10.1
	* Fixed mem leaks in MailWindowController: -dealloc. We were
	  retaining instead of releasing all table columns!
	* We now allow columns reordering in the dataView (will save
	  the order, later)


2002-10-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small bug with the Delete (now Remove)
          button in ReceivingExpertView.m
	* Modified MailWindowController (Private)
	  -_outlineViewShouldReloadData to support sorting.
	* Added autoresizing support for images in ExtendedTextView:
	  -insertFile.


2002-10-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactored some parts of the code (mostly cleaned
	  some FIXME and fixed some UI issues).
	* Fixed a small bug in ComposeViewController (we
	  weren't doing the layout of the expertView).


2002-10-09     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Fixed minor little things in previous commit.


2002-10-08	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

        * Initial integration with Apple's AddressBook on 
          MacOS X 10.2. Preference can be set by:
          
          defaults write com.collaboration-world.GNUMail ADDRESSBOOK_TYPE 1
          
          Pressing AddressBook button now launches Apple's AddressBook.
          Saving addresses from messages inserts them into Apple's AddressBook.
          Drag and Drop from AddressBook to Composer window is not yet implemented.
        
        * Added slightly better address auto-completion support 
          in the Composer window. The auto-completion is implemented 
          by a drop-down list provided by an extended NSComboBox.
          Auto-completion works with both GNUMail.app's built-in 
          addressbook and Apple's AddresBook.
          
        * Updated ProjectBuilder project file to include 
          a stub framework to fix a linking problem on MacOS X 10.2
          

2002-10-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed some littles issues for tableviews in
	  both Sending and Receiving pref bundles.


2002-10-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added FontsExpertView / FontsView for the Fonts
	  preferences panel. I will commit all other 
	  panels in the following hours. Only the UI has
	  been done. Modified the FontsViewController to make
	  use of either the standard or the expert view.
	  Modified the GNUmakefile to include the new
	  FontsExpertView class.
	* Done the same thing with:
	  - Sending
	  - Receiving
	  - Compose
	* Done TODO #322. Added a new preference (see
	  docs/PREFERENCES) DEFAULT_MULTIPART_ALTERNATIVE_TYPEE
	  so that it's now possible to specify if we want to
	  favor text/plain or text/html parts in mutlipart/alternative
	  content.


2002-10-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the MailHeaderCell drawing code under Mac OS X.
	* Fixed MessageViewWindowTool so that we no longer use
	  the listIndex ivar.
	* Done TODO #323. We now save the mode (standard/expert)
	  when closing the pref panel and we use that mode when
	  re-opening it.


2002-10-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small bug in MailWindowController: -deleteMessage
	  that would generate an index out of bounds exception when
	  using message threading and deleting the last message of
	  the folder.
	* Improved a little bit MailWindowController (Private)
	  +_outlineViewShouldReloadData.
	* Modified Utilities: +attributedStringFromHeadersForMessage:
	  showAllHeaders (also added the useMailHeaderCell parameter) 
	  to NOT show the MailHeaderCell for message/rfc822 parts
	  of a multipart object but ONLY for the real message.
	* Adjusted the MailHeaderCell drawing code under GNUstep


2002-10-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -setFolder so that
	  setting the fromColum to To/From depending on the folder
	  works again.
	* Applied a small fix in MailWindowController (Private):
	  _objectValueForTableColumn: message: item: just to be
	  sure we have at least one recipient instead of assuming
	  we have at least one.
	* Done TODO #317. Bound the Delete button. It now marks
	  the selected message as deleted and selects the next one.
	* Fixed the Next/Previous buttons behaviour in 
	  MessageViewWindowController.
	

2002-10-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Fixed TODO #313. We now colorize properly the
	  first line if it is quoted.


2002-10-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added some fixes to the message threading code.
          New messages will now be shown.
	* Refactored some of the code of FindWindowController and
	  reactivated the find feature IIF you're NOT using
	  message threading.


2002-09-28     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -getNewMessages so that
	  we can trap the exception generated by -base when detaching
	  the new thread didn't work.


2002-09-27     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in GNUMail: -loadBundles. We were ignore
	  everything except the user's lib dir due to a stupid
	  typo.


2002-09-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added '?' as a trailing character to exclude in
	  Utilities: + _highlightAndActivateURLs


2002-09-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: + _highlightAndActivateURLs to
	  not include the trailing "." in the URLs.
	* Enhanced some more the previous commit in the same
	  method to include "," and "!" and also to add "www."
	  as a parsing "prefix".


2002-09-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactored some code in MailWindowController so
	  that adding sorting support and reloading support
	  for the outline view (when being in message threading
	  mode) is easier and more generic to all other classes
	  using the MailWindowController instance.
	* Added a patch from Stefan Urbanek <urbanek@host.sk>
	  that replaces setBackgroundColor of NSTextViews from 
	  white to textBackgroundColor.
	* Fixed a typo in NewMailboxPanel.nib (reported by
	  Anders Nasmark <andnas@home.se>)
	* Fixed a mem leak in ExtendedCell: -dealloc


2002-09-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Corrected a small bug in MailWindowController:
          -updateStatusLabel.


2002-09-23	Ujwal S. Sathyam	<ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Removed duplicate entry for ChangeLog from PB project.
	  Hadn't realized that it was already there in the 
	  Documentation sub-group.


2002-09-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: +fontFromFamilyName: trait: size:
	  so that we look for the font that has ONLY this trait,
	  not this trait among others (left the old code for
	  testing reasons for now).
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -outlineView:
	  shouldCollapseItem: to close the MailWindowController
	  IIF the folder shown is from this IMAP store and also
	  if we are re-using the MailWindow. 
	* Done TODO #308. Changed every occurences of "Verify on
	  startup.. " for "Check on startup". The pref value
	  VERIFYONSTARTUP was replaced by CHECKONSTARTUP. The
	  old one is no longer used and will be discarded when
	  the prefs will be modified. Suggestion by Tim Harrison.
	  The OS X nib (ReceivingWindow.nib) NEEDS to be updated.
	* Done TODO #297. We now use NSArray: -initWithArray: copyItems:
	  since it's now in -base and we now require at least GNUstep 
          base 1.5 run GNUMail.app.
	* Done TODO #311. SHOWALLHEADERS now works again in 
	  MailWindowController.


2002-09-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Moved MailWindowController (Private):
          _launchExternalProgram to Utilities (Private) to
          prevent a segfault when using an external program
          to open a specific attachment. Bug reported by
          Andreas Heppel <aheppel@web.de>.
	* Fixed a bug in the PGP bundle. We now use the charset
	  of the part before writing it to our pipe in order
	  to not get empty data when the content wasn't a pure
	  ASCII stream.
	* Modified ExtendedWindow.m so that when we press the return
	  key, it acts like a double-click.
	* Implemented message threading support (NOT FINISHED, TODO #158).
	  Newly received messages won't show up unless you restart the application.
	  Problems will occurs when changing selection in MessageWindow. FindWindow
	  won't work.
	  To activate it do:
	  defaults write GNUMail MAILWINDOW_DATA_VIEW_TYPE 2
	  To go back to the previous mode, do:
	  defaults write GNUMail MAILWINDOW_DATA_VIEW_TYPE 1
	* Updated MailWindow.nib


2002-09-21	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Done TODO #248: We can now drag and drop attachments from 
	  Finder and GWorkspace.
	* Added UI in NewMailboxPanel to specify mbox, maildir, or folder.


2002-09-14     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Done TODO #261. We now offer a preview of the
          selected fonts in the Fonts preferences panel.
	  The OS X nib FontsView will have to be updated.
	* Updated PreferencesWindow.nib and FontsView.nib
	* Updated (temporarely) PersonalView.nib


2002-09-13     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail: -loadBundles so it's now possible
	  to load bundles from domains other than the user domain.
	  This WILL have to be modified to ignore the bundles
	  the user doesn't want to load automatically.
	* Modified the Personal Preferences bundle,  
	  PreferencesWindowController and the bundle interface
	  so that it almost work for standard/expert mode. More
	  work needs to be done. For example, it currently won't
	  save anything if you're using the Standard mode. Also,
	  it won't work under OS X for now. More to come on this later.
 

2002-09-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the code of the AddressBook to use the new
	  NSBrowser code in GNUstep. We now use the same code
	  under both GNUstep and OS X.
	* Slightly modified the Personal bundle for the signature
	  selection in order to improve usability. Only the GNUstep
	  UI has been modified. The Mac OS X nib needs to be updated.
	* Fixed a bug in the PGP bundle. We weren't verifying that the
	  content was really a NSString object for text/plain encrypted
	  or signed messages. Also set the version number to v0.3.0
	* Heavily modified the Preferences window (and it's controller)
	  for permitting 'standard' and 'expert' panels. All the current
	  panels are 'expert' panels. This code WILL NOT work under OS X
	  right now. Updates to the nibs need to be done (more to come
	  later on this). 


2002-09-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ExtendedOutlineView and ExtendedTableView to
	  return YES for acceptsFirstMouse:


2002-09-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated Spanish translation - patch from
 	  Quique <quique@sindominio.net>.


2002-09-09     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -initWithWindowNibName:
	  to that we don't try to set the table view row height
	  under OS X.
	* Fixed a bug from previous commit for TODO #310. We now
	  set back the column header cell to From when we aren't
	  in Outbox or Drafts.


2002-09-07	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Completed previous commit for TODO #310: 
	Rename "From" column to "To" when showing Outbox or Drafts.


2002-09-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Done TODO #310. In Outbox and Drafts 
	  folders, show 'To' in the table instead of 'From'


2002-09-07	Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* Set the EditWindow's textView resizingMask to NSViewWidthSizable.


2002-09-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a patch from Stefan Urbanek <urbanek@host.sk> to
          properly set the row height of the table view
          in MailWindowController: -initWithWindowNibName: depending
          of the font.
	* Added a patch from Stefan Urbanek <urbanek@host.sk> to
	  display the dates in the Date column in the same (local)
	  time zone.


2002-09-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -deleteMessage so it selects
          the next message if the delete key is pressed.
	* Added some TODOs
	* Added Utilities: +_attributedStringFromTextForPart and refactored
	  the code in Utilities to use that method. 
          +bestRepresentationFromMultipartAlternative now works way better.


2002-09-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a patch from D. Marc Stearman <marc@mordred.punk.net>
          to add new key bindings (pageUp, pageDown and space bar)
        * Updated version numbers.


2002-09-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set the CVS tag to v1_0_3
        * RELEASED v1.0.3

                
2002-09-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the GNUmakefile to include Goodies/Welcome
	* Fixed a bug in MailboxManagerController. We weren't
	  carefully removing the "secure" icon when switching
	  to a non-secure folder.
	* Modified MainMenu.nib to include the "C" key binding
	  for compacting the current mailbox on OS X
	* Updated German translation. Patch from
	  Martin Brecher <martin@mb-itconsulting.com>.
	* Fixed a small bug related to tempnam() on OS X for the
	  PGP bundle.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -tableViewSelectionDidChange
	  so that we refresh our matrix after showing the message.
	* Applied a patch from Ujwal to fix a display problem when
	  double-clicking on a message in a mail window not on top


2002-09-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Regenerated the Localizable.strings files for:
	  English
	  French
	  Spanish
	  Swedish
          (German hasn't been done since it's not using fauxStep.pl)
	* Updated the French translation
	* Adjusted the size of some UI elements on GNUstep
	* Fixed some localization bugs in GNUMail.m
	* Added some TODO items
	* Added Alt-Shift-C for compacting the current mailbox
          (need to add the key binding on OS X)


2002-09-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated signed_20.tiff and unsigned_20.tiff


2002-08-31     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Cleaned a FIXME, documented some methods and
          refactored some code.
	* Added some TODO items


2002-08-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Cleaned a FIXME.
	* Added #import "GNUMailConstants.h" to Face.m and
	  FaceController.m
	* Cleaned the Face bundle so it works well under OS X
	* Added the Face bundle to the OS X project file (new
	  Face target, groups and files)


2002-08-30	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Updated MacOS X project file to reflect the names of the new icons.


2002-08-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed an extra issue in the previous commit.
	  With the change made, it was no longer possible to
	  open an other IMAP folder from the same IMAP server
	  if we were reusing the MailWindow. Everything should
	  be fine now. 
	* Modified the following icons:
	  MailIcon_attach.tiff => attach_32.tiff and attach_48.tiff
	  MailIcon_bcc.tiff => add_bcc_32.tiff and add_bcc_48.tiff
	  MailIcon_bcc_remove.tiff => remove_bcc_32.tiff and remove_bcc_48.tiff
	  MailIcon_cc.tiff => add_cc_32.tiff and add_cc_48.tiff
	  MailIcon_cc_remove.tiff => remove_cc_32.tiff and remove_cc_48.tiff
	  MailIcon_send.tiff => send_32.tiff and send_48.tiff	
	  MailIcon_stop.tiff => stop_32.tiff and stop_48.tiff
	* Removed the following icons:
	  MailIcon_box_open.tiff
	  MailIcon_box_transfer.tiff
	* Modified most .m files to reflect the names of the new icons.
 	  NOTE: The OS X project file NEEDS to be updated for the new icons.
	* Fixed some icons (removed LZW compression and more).


2002-08-30	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Fixed a bug in MailboxManagerController: - (void) openIMAPFolderWithName: store: 
	  that was closing the previous folder even if the REUSE_MAIL_WINDOW preference 
	  was not set. This caused emails not from the previous mailbox not 
	  to be displayed. An additional danger of this was that a subsequent 
	  "Compact" of the first mailbox would cause the mbox file to be 
	  written with missing messages.
	  

2002-08-29     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed some TODO items that have been completed.
	* Fixed a bug in Utilities: +replyToSender: folder and
	  Utilities: +replyToAll: folder: since those two methods
	  were generating exception if the profile name wasn't found
	  (so == nil) when we were trying to remove the InternetAddress
	  object for this profile name from the list of recipients.


2002-08-28     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Done TODO #295. Added a patch from Stefan Urbanek
  	  <urbanek@host.sk> to improve the time/date format
	  of the MailWindow's date column. See docs/PREFERENCES
	  for more informations.
	* Modified FilterManager so that if the default mailbox
	  for a receiving account has been deleted, we now at least
	  default to INBOXFOLDERNAME so we won't loose the mails
	  being transferred to a non-existent mailbox.
	* Modified GNUMail: -markMessageAsReadOrUnread so that when
	  we mark the messages as read / unread, we refresh our status
	  label in the last mail window on top and also our outline view
	  in the MailboxManager.
	* Refactored some code in GNUMail.m
	* Fixed Utilities: +attributedStringFromContentForPart:
	  We now use the message's encoding from the charset instead
	  of always using (and wrongly) NSASCIIStringEncoding.
	* Removed the current icons from the PGP bundle and replaced
	  them with a 20x20 and 48x48 version. Modified the code to use
	  the new icons.
	* Updated the OS X project file for the PGP bundle (new icons).
	* Fixed a typo in Utilities: +attributedStringFromHeadersForMessage:
	  showAllHeaders: that was preventing the HEADER_VALUE_FONT_SIZE from
	  being used.
	* Done TODO #275. Fixed the font issues when first starting up GNUMail.app.
	  The font panel would set the fonts to Lucida 8 on OS X which is WAY TOO
	  small. Changed to 10 so now things are perfect.


2002-08-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a TODO.
	* Fixed a memory leak in FilteringViewController: -duplicate:.
	* Fixed -copyWithZone: for the Filter and for the FilterCriteria
	  classes.
	* Fixed some bugs in MailboxManagerController where we were
	  wrongly assuming that the lastMailWindowOnTop (it's controller)
	  was an instance of MailWindowController.
	* Modified MailWindowController and MessageViewWindowController so
	  that when we close a MailWindow or when we change the folder
	  (if we reuse a MailWindow and we select an other folder in the
	  MailboxManager), we now automatically close all MessageViewWindows
	  that have been opened for messages of this specific folder.
	* Fixed a stupid mistake in previous commit.


2002-08-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified MailWindowController to set the matrix cell
	  size to 20x20 on OS X
	* Ported the GPG bundle to OS X. Added the nib and
	  did some modifications to the controller classes
	  so that everything works well.
          EditWindowController was heavily modified to so that
          _loadAccessoryViews can position the view coming from
          the bundle properly in the toolbar. Added two new
          ivars to make everything dynamic.
        * Added the PGP target to the OS X project file. It is
          NOT included in the "Everything" target.
	* Added PGPView.nib
	* Minor refactoring in some classes (Utilites.m and 
	  EditWindowController.m)
	* Modified PreferencesWindowController so that
	  all cells added because of bundles in the NSMatrix
	  have the same properties as the other "default cells".
	* Modified PGPController so that the NSButton objects we
	  return on OS X are smaller than their GNUstep variant. 

          
2002-08-25	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Utilities.m: Fixed a bug in showMessage:target:showAllHeaders where the code 
	  was assuming the [lastWindowOnTop delegate] was a MailWindowController and hence calling 
	  the MailWindowController:-tableView directly. Now checking class of window delegate.
	* Utilities.m: Fixed a bug in _highlightAndActivateURLs: The code was looking for URL types in the 
	  message string serially, i.e. it would fail to detect a mixed set of URL types, "https://" 
	  coming before "http://" where the "https://" URL would occur before the "http://" URL. 
	  Now we have an array of URL types that we walk through and scan for in the message body. 
	  More expensive, but has to be done.


2002-08-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Small enchancements to the GPG bundle so that we
          also parse the status-fd if the exit code > 0. More
          improvements need to be done there.
	* Modified MailWindowController to set the matrix cell
	  size to 20x20 on OS X
	* Ported the GPG bundle to OS X. Added the nib and
	  did some modifications to the controller classes
	  so that everything works well.


2002-08-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified PGPController so we handle sigs that have
          expired.
	* Modified the bundle interface to allow 3 types of 
	  viewing bundles:

	  ViewingViewTypeToolbar
	  ViewingViewTypeStatusBar
	  ViewingViewTypeHeaderCell

	  Some cleaning needs to be done for ViewingViewTypeToolbar
	  on OS X and ViewingViewTypeHeaderCell (and also the Face
	  bundle that use that one).
	* Modified a lot of code so that the new bundle interface
	  works.
	* Modified the code of all bundles (PGP,Clock and Face) to
	  use the new interface. ALL THOSE BUNDLE *** MUST ***
	  BE RE-INSTALLED.
	* Updated the version number of the OS X port
	* Added the matrix in the MailWindow and connected the
	  outlet to the controller. Modified the controller to
	  initialize the matrix to the right cell prototype.
	* Fixed the MailHeaderCell drawing artifacts on OS X.
	* Added NSToolbar support in EditWindow and made some
	  little modifications all over the place.
	* Added NSToolbar support in BounceWindow
	* Fixed autoresizing properties of some UI elements
	  in EditWindow.m
	* Set the custom class of the window to ExtendedWindow
	  in MessageViewWindow.nib
	* Fixed all references to the "delete.tiff" icons in
	  all nibs.
        * Done TODO #284. When showing the content-type header,
          we also show the charset since it has been 'removed'
          by Pantomime during the decode operation.
	* Minor optimization in MailHeaderCell: _fold.
	

2002-08-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Made MessageViewWindow a subclass of ExtendedWindow and
	  implemented -firstMessage and -lastMessage in the controller
	  class. We still need to set the custom class of the NSWindow
	  to ExtendedWindow in the OS X nib.
	* Cleaned some FIXMEs and re-activated GNUMail: -getNewMessages:
	  More work needs to be done in GNUMail: -updateGetNewMailMenuItems:
	  to use the UNIX accounts.
	* Modified Utilities: +showMessage: target: showAllHeaders: to
	  refresh properly the table view of the last mail window (or
	  message window) on top so that if an unread mail was read,
	  we refresh the specific row of the table view since it was
	  marked as unread.


2002-08-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a couple of TODO entries.
	* Made the EditWindow resizable under GNUstep.
	* Reactivated the verifyOnStartup feature for
	  POP3 accounts.


2002-08-21	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
	
	* MessageViewWindowController.m: -dealloc: Commented out 
	  [[self window] setToolbar: nil] for MacOS X.
	  Does not seem to a source of crash as we initially suspected.


2002-08-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Changed all calls from bzero() to memset().


2002-08-18	Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added Icons/down_15.tiff and Icons/up_15.tiff for
	  Mac OS X version.
	* Changed navigation NSView in MailWindow and
	  MessageViewWindow nibs.


2002-08-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Icons/show_all_headers_48.tiff from
          Banlu Kemiyatorn <id@project-ile.net>. _32 needs
          to be done and added to the OS X version.
	* Modified MessageViewWindow.m to use this icon.
	* Updated UNIXView.nib and ReceivingView.nib
	* Added Icons/show_all_headers_32.tiff
	* Added the "Show All Headers" toolbar item
	  in the MessageViewWindow category.


2002-08-17      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Enhanced a lot the GPG/PGP bundle. Introduced a way to
          verify --status-fd so we can now safely add more error-handling
          code.
	* Refactored the code in MailHeaderCell a little big and also fixed
	  some minor annoyances in MailWindowController/ReceivingView.


2002-08-16	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Removed delete_20.tiff from PB project on MAcOS X.
	* Fixed crash in MailWindowController: -dealloc. Not setting
	  toolbar to nil.
	* MessageViewWindowController.m: Changed AutoSaveName from ViewMailWindow to 
	  MessageViewWindow to match nib file.


2002-08-16      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the GNUmakefile, MailWindow.m and MailboxManager.m
	  to use the new icon names.
	* Done the same thing in MessageViewWindow.m
	* Fixed a crash bug in MessageViewWindowController when removing
	  the observer and fixed a potential bug (same problem) in
	  MailWindowController.
	* Small icon fix in MailWindowController.m
	* Did some refactoring in Utilities.m
	* Fixed the addresses icon problem in EditWindow.m and BounceWindow.m
	* Modified quite a lot the source code so that we now make use of the 
	  default "receiving mailbox" once can specify in the receiving
	  preferences window for POP3 and for UNIX accounts.
	* Fixed the pipe handling in PGPController.m so we can now encrypt
	  big files!


2002-08-15	Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Renamed following tiff files:
	  delete.tiff => delete_20.tiff
	  MailIcon_box_delete.tiff => delete_32.tiff
	  MailIcon_delete.tiff => delete_48.tiff
	  MailIcon_retrieve.tiff => retrieve_48.tiff

	  retrieve_32.tiff
	  addresses_32.tiff
	  reply_32.tiff
	  forward_32.tiff
	  find_32.tiff

2002-08-15      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added [[self window] setToolbar: nil]; in MailWindowController:
          -dealloc.
	* Added a mailHeaderCell ivar (and an accessor) to MailWindowController
	  and MessageViewWindowController to fix the resize issue we had
	  using a singleton for that class (MailHeaderCell).


2002-08-13	Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Updated MailboxManager NIB with newest controller header file.
	* Added NSToolbar under Mac OS X for MailWindow.
	* Resized icons MailIcon_delete.tiff, MailIcon_forward.tiff, and
	  MailIcon_reply.tiff.
	* Updated ProjectBuilder project file.


2002-08-13      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -dealloc so that under OS X
 	  we set the window's toolbar to nil to prevent the window from
	  trying to use released objects in -update when closing.
	* Did the same thing in MessageViewWindowController: -dealloc.
	* Modified MailWindowController and MailboxManagerController so that
	  we also set the bg color of the table/outline view's scrollview.
	  NOTE: The new scrollView outlet in MailboxManagerController needs to
	  be connected in IB under OS X.


2002-08-12      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController.m so that we
          can now change the background color of the outline view
          by using the MAILBOXMANAGER_OUTLINE_COLOR preferences key.
          See docs/PREFERENCES for details.


2002-08-11      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Renamed MOVES_MESSAGE to MOVE_MESSAGES in 
          MailboxManager.m


2002-08-11      Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added NSToolbar under Mac OS X for MailboxManager and
	  MessageViewWindow.


2002-08-10      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMailConstants.h to define the NSDebugLog
	  variadic macro.
	* Modified the OS X project file to use --traditional-cpp.
	* Added the NSUserDefaultsExtensions category files to the
	  OS X project file and also fixed a bug in the 
	  FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS.
	* Added docs/PREFERENCES. This document contains informations
	  about GNUMail.app's extra preferences that you can set using
	  the "defaults" tool.
	* Added a patch from Nicolas Roard <nicolas@roard.com> for
	  Utilities: +_quoteMessageContentFromAttributedString:
	  to support coloration depending on the quoting level.
	  You can modify the quoting colors by chaning the 
	  QUOTE_COLOR_LEVEL_{1,2,3,4} default values. See docs/PREFERENCES
	  for more informations.
	* Modified MailHeaderCell so that we can now set the background color
	  of the cell using the new user's default MAILHEADERCELL_COLOR.
	  See docs/PREFERENCES for details.


2002-08-09      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Utilities: +clickedOnCell: inRect: atIndex: and refactored
	  MailWindowController and MessageViewController to use this method.
	* Added a "Show/Hide All Headers" button in MessageViewWindow. More
	  work needs to be done here (the nib, an icon to make, 
	  and also a small bug to fix).
	* Refactored some code.
	* Added NSUserDefaultsExtensions to provide -colorForKey and also
	  setColor: forKey:
	* Modified MailWindowController: -initWithWindowNibName to set te
	  table background color, if defined. You can easily set it by using,
	  under GNUstep for example:
	  defaults write GNUMail MAILWINDOW_TABLE_COLOR "0.850980 0.737255 0.576471"
	  to have a nice "salmon" table background color.
	
	
2002-08-08	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Utilities.m: When doing a "Reply To All" on a message,
	  original recipient is taken out of the recipient list. 
	  This is done by matching recipient list against the 
	  profile address.


2002-08-08      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Minor fixes in Utilities.m and MailHeaderCell.m so that
          the cell gets drawn properly.
	* Fixed the mem leak and we now remove the observer on the
	  MailHeaderCell object.
	* Replaced all NSLog() calls for NSDebugLog(). If you want
	  those messages, just do:
	  openapp GNUMail.app --GNU-Debug=dflt
	  under GNUstep. I need to implement NSDebugLog() on OS X.
	* Modified Utilities: +attributedStringFromHeadersForMessage:
	  showAllHeaders: so that if we are showing all headers and we
	  have some Resent-* headers, it won't bork.


2002-08-08      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailHeaderCell.m to import GNUMailConstants.h
	* Modified the OS X project file to include the new
	  MailHeaderCell class. This class currently does NOT
	  work under OS X.


2002-08-07	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching so
	  that if the user default OPEN_MAILBOXMANAGER_ON_STARTUP
	  exists and is equal to YES, we automatically open the mailbox
	  manager's window upon GNUMail.app's startup. To activate this,
	  simply type:
	  % defaults write GNUMail OPEN_MAILBOXMANAGER_ON_STARTUP YES
	* Added a new class - MailHeaderCell so that we now do our
	  own cell rendering for headers. Patch from Nicolas Roard 
	  <nicolas@roard.com> heavily modified by me.

	
2002-08-06	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* When replying to or forwarding a message, GNUMail.app
	  tries to guess the appropriate personal profile to use.
	  It does this by scanning the recipients of the message 
	  and comparing that to the email address stored for each 
	  personal profile.


2002-08-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed the bug where trying to re-open an IMAP folder
          when reusing the MailWindow would lead to an error
          ("Must select a valid mailbox...").
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -outlineView:
	  shouldCollapseItem: so that we verify that our IMAP
	  store is connected before trying to close the connection.


2002-08-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -setFolder to
          set the delegate on the IMAPFolder. Also
          implemented IMAPFolder's delegate method
          (newMessagesWereReceived:) so that we
          are now notified directly by the IMAPFolder
          object when new messages were received.
	* Fixed a bug in PersonalViewController.m. When
	  deleting a profile, the content of the deleted
	  profile was replacing the newly selected
	  profile.


2002-08-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified TransportMethodEditorWindowController:
          -supportedMechanismsButtonClicked so that we
          use the SMTP port value defined in the textfield
          instead of assuming it's always 25.
	* Done TODO #274. Added a patch from Vincent Ricard 
	  <magicninja@wanadoo.fr> (modified by myself) to 
	  provide a "Save All Attachments" option from the
	  menu.
	* Modified IMAPViewController so that we prompt for
	  the password if it hasn't been defined in the
	  password secure field.

        
2002-08-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified PGPController: -_decryptPart:... so that
          we do NOT ask for the passphrase signed messages
          (only signed).


2002-07-31     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController.m to show a message
  	  in the Console when noop'ing an IMAP folder.
	* Modified PGPController: - _decryptPart: ...
	  so that we first verify if the outFilename exists
	  before trying to do anything with it!
	* Fixed a bug in GPController: - _decryptPart: ... when
	  we were decoding only signed messages
	* Refactored some code to use Pantomime's get/set
	  methods for extra message properties and fixed some
	  minor bugs.


2002-07-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the charset label/popup button back
	  in EditWindow. Modified the controller class to
	  set the width of the new window to 750 instead
	  of 650 (and also modified the dynamically ajusted
	  widths of most UI elements).


2002-07-29     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail/GNUMailBundle.h to add
	  -messageWasEncoded:
	* Added Bundles/PGP/clear.tiff, encrypted.tiff,
	  signed.tiff and unsigned.tiff
	* Modified EditWindow to remove TEMPORARILY the
	  label/combo for selecting the charset
	* Added EditWindowController: _loadAccessoryViews
	* Modified EditWindowController: -updateMessageContentFromTextView
	  to notify our bundles when message encoding is done
	* Implemented the first 'version' of the PGP bundle!
	

2002-07-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Bundles/Face (for X-Face / X-Image-URL support)


2002-07-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -setFolder so that we
          don't call -close on the folder if it is an IMAPFolder.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -tableView:
	  objectValueForTableColumn: row: so that we now use
	  the user default's MAILWINDOW_DATE_FORMAT when 
	  creating the description of the date. By default, it'll
	  show a date like "Jul 16 2002" but one can easily change it
	  using the "defaults" tool like:
	  defaults write GNUMail MAILWINDOW_DATE_FORMAT "%b %d %Y %I:%M %p"
	* Added MailboxManagerController: -outlineView: shouldCollapseItem:
	  so that we now prompt the user if he/she wants to close the IMAP
	  connection to the server when collapsing the node of the latter.
	* Removed some done TODO items.


2002-07-13	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Fixed a bug in MailWindowController.m that caused a crash 
	  when closing an IMAP connection. Caused by referencing a 
	  released NSString object while posting a notification.
	* MessageViewWindowController.m: No longer repainting message 
	  when window becomes key. Not necessary. This eliminates 
	  annoying visual glitches of message scrolling back to top 
	  whenever window was brought to top.


2002-07-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We no longer set the max width of the Date table
          column in MailWindow.m


2002-07-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added some #defines to LocalMailDelivery so things will
	  properly compile under Solaris.


2002-07-06	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* Moved showRawSourceLogic to from GNUMail.m to Utilities.m so 
	  that state for each open window is remembered correctly.
	* When a new mailbox is opened (local or IMAP), its window 
	  becomes key.


2002-07-05	Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>
	
	* MailWindowController.m: Displaying time in the Date column.


2002-07-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Simplified the logic in ViewingViewController (for handling
          the DOUBLECLICKACTION pref value) and fixed a simple bug.
	* Fixed a bug the would prevent a user to reuse a MailWindow
	  when trying to open an other folder on the same IMAP store.


2002-07-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated docs/WHOIS, docs/README and the GNUMailInfo.plist
	* Modified GNUMail.m and PreferencesWindowController.m so that
	  we no longer show the Preferences panel in the modal loop.
	* Modified BounceWindowController and EditWindowController so that
	  we properly exit the exception handler in case of a wrong
	  SMTP password. This fix a crash bug when sending a mail using
	  SMTP AUTH while specifying a wrong password.
	* Fixed a bug in ReceivingViewController. We no longer remove the
	  volatile domain on OS X. This fixes a crash bug when deleting
	  a receiving account.
	* Modified Utilities: +loadTransportMethodsInPopUpButton so that we
	  include the profile name in the value of the popup to avoid
	  index errors in EditWindow/BounceWindow. Suggestion/bugfix from
	  Marco Steinbach <mdev@executive-computing.de>.
	* Added Utilities: +fontFromFamilyName: trait: size: and refactored
	  a lot of code in Utilities to use this new method. This should fix
	  all font issues in GNUMail.app.


2002-06-30     Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>

	* GNUMail.m: fixed a few methods that were assuming last window on top 
	  was a MailWindowController. It could also be a MessageViewController.


2002-06-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed IMAPMailWindow* and LocalInboxWindow* and 
          put all the logic in MailWindowController.
        * Modified quite a lot the receiving preferences.
          Removed the "Mail spool file" options and added
          a UNIXView to the ReceivingWindow.
	* Removed NSRegExRange since we now use NSValue instead
	  of this class.
	* Removed all UI elements related to the mail spool file
	  selection in ReceivingView (moved to UNIXView) and moved
	  all the logic from ReceivingViewController to
	  UNIXViewController.
	* Removed IMAPMailWindow.nib and LocalInboxWindow.nib
	* Integrated some work done by Ujwal S. Sathyam <ujwal@setlurgroup.com>.
	  Moved a lot of methods from MailWindowController to Utilities.
	  MessageViewWindowController: new class by Ujwal so that we can
	  "see" a message in a separate window (when double-clicking on it)
	  MessageViewWindow.nib: new nib from Ujwal
	  MessageViewWindow: new class from me for GNUstep
	  Modified ViewingView/ViewingViewController/ViewingView.nib to
	  allow the user to specify its pref on double-click.
	  Refactored some code in GNUMail (the class) so that most methods
	  (like showRAWSource, etc) will work with the new 
	  MessageViewWindowController class.
	* Updated the OS X project file.
	* Updated MailWindow.nib
	* Updated MailboxesView.nib
	* NOTE: THE WORK ISN'T FINISHED AND IT IS NOT RECOMMANDED
	        TO CURRENTLY USE THIS CVS VERSION.


2002-06-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the GNUMailInfo.plist
	* Added UNIXView.nib and updated the OS X project file,
	  POP3View.nib and ReceivingWindow.nib.


2002-06-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Done TODO #278. If the URL has a > suffix, we strip it.


2002-06-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the concept of "UNIX" receiving accounts.
          Currently not used but, saved and restored properly from
          the defaults.
        * It's now possible to specify in which mailbox you want to
          transfer (by default) your emails from a POP3 account.
          Currently not used but, saved and restored properly from
          the defaults too.


2002-06-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Connected the missing "showAllHeaders" outlet in MainMenu.nib
	* Modified TransportMethodEditorWindow.nib to include
	  the port field.


2002-06-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified TransportEditorWindow* so that it's now possible
          to specify the port for a SMTP transport method.
        * Modified EditWindowController and BounceWindowController
          to make use of the SMTP port, if defined.
        * Modified GNUMailConstants.m to change the version number
          to 1.0.3.

        
2002-05-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set the cvs tag to v1_0_2
	* RELEASED v1.0.2


2002-05-29     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Replaced alert message in MailboxManagerController
	  -openLocalFolderWithName by showing the proper window.


2002-05-29     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed two small mem leaks in BounceWindowController. We were not
 	  releasing our SMTP or Sendmail object.
	* Removed all invalidate calls in EditWindowController and
	  BounceWindowController.


2002-05-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Commented out all calls to [NSThread exit].
	* Added a patch from Vincent Ricard <vricard@wanadoo.fr>
	  so TODO #275 (setting the port value in ReceivingWindow
	  to a "good" value depending if SSL is activated) is done.
	* Fixed a typo in GNUMail.h/.m (ExtendedMenuItem instead of
	  ExtentedMenuItem)
	* Modified ReceivingWindow.nib to link the action of the
	  "Use SSL checkbox" to -sslClicked.
	* Fixed some bugs in PersonalViewController and two memory
	  leaks.


2002-05-24     Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* MailWindowController.m : Fixed a typo ("," instead of ";").


2002-05-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small mem leak in EditWindowController and refactored
	  some code.
	* Modified GNUMail: -applicationWillFinishLaunching so that we 
	  don't set th application icon on OS X.


2002-05-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Minor enhancements to invalidate correctly NSPort objects.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -transferMessageFromRawSource: ...
	  so that we not only verify if theRawSource is nil but also
	  if its length > 0.
	* Modified GNUMail: -cut so that we don't mark the messages
	  as transferred if the previous copy operation failed for at least
	  one message.
	* Connected the missing icon outlet in BounceWindow.nib


2002-05-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -transferMessageFromRawSource: ...
	  so that when we obtain the folderForName for an IMAP store,
	  we don't select the folder.
	* Added an extra check in this method so that if the rawSource is nil,
	  we immediately return NO. Also modified GNUMail: -applyManualFilter so
	  that if we failed at transferring the message, we won't mark it as
	  transferred.


2002-05-21     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Fixed autosizing of FilterEditorWindow.nib
	* Fixed target of GNUMail.framework in Project Builder file


2002-05-21     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now use an exception handler when invalidating ports/connection
	  in LocalInboxWindowController. Exceptions seem to be generated
	  sometimes under GNUstep for no good reasons.
	* We do the same thing when invalidating the NSConnection object
	  in the threads.
	* We now properly set the raw source of our message in
	  FilterManager: -matchedURLNameFromMessageAsRawSource: type:.
	* Fixed a couple of lame errors in GNUMail.m when we were converting
	  the old defaults to the new ones for *FOLDERNAME defaults.


2002-05-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Made LocalInboxWindowController: _matchFilterRuleFromRawSource:
          connection: thread-safe.
	* Moved the code to inform the user about transferred messages from
	  filters from -messagesWereReceived to -threadWillExit (in
	  LocalInboxWindowController).
	* LocalInboxWindowController: -messageWasReceived: forURLName: is no
	  longer one way.
	* Modified MainMenu.nib so that we show "Hide GNUMail" instead of
	  "Hide NewApplication" in the app menu.
	* Modified all nibs to make use of small scrollbars.
	* Fixed FindWindow.nib. No outlets were connected nor actions
	  specified!

         
2002-05-19     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified FilterManager: - _messageFromExternalProgramUsingFilter:
          message: so that we don't wait until the task has ended its
          execution. See the comment in the code.
	* Fixed a small bug in MimeTypeManager while getting the best 
	  MIME type for a file extension (we weren't verifying if
	  we had an extension!).


2002-05-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactored a lot of code that was initializing a target mailbox
          on an IMAP server to always use Utilities: +storeForURLName.
        * Fixed a bug when renaming folders (local or IMAP). We weren't
          anymore renaming the target mailbox for filters.
	* Fixed a typo in Utilities: +initializeLocalAndIMAPFolderNodes
	  (in the method name) and updated the code that was using this
	  method.


2002-05-19     Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* LocalInboxWindowController.m : call expunge before calling close
	on a folder.
	removed folder cleaning code from _transferMessagesFromPOP3Folder

	
2002-05-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a crash bug if we were getting mails only from one
          server.


2002-05-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Reactivated the functionnality in GNUMail: -applyManualFilter.
	  The code will work well except if you have a DELETE action
	  on your filter. It currently won't do anything for this.


2002-05-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a patch from Chris B. Vetter <chrisv@web4inc.com> so that
	  GNUMail: -checkForUpdates works under GNUstep.
	* Increased the request/reply timeouts in LocalInboxWindowController
	  to a full day instead of five minutes (on GNUstep).
	* We now correctly invalidate the ports we use and release the
	  connection we create in the threads in LocalInboxWindowController.
	* We now invalidate the connection created in the thread before releasing it in 
	  BounceWindowController and EditWindowController.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController: -getNewMessages so that we call
	  -threadWillExit if the [allKeys count] >= 1 and not > 1.


2002-05-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added tooltips to some of the UI elements in the
	  Preferences Panel. Work done by me and 
	  Georges Tabouriech.
	* Fixed some bugs in the ReceivingView.nib.


2002-05-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified LocalInboxWindowController to fix the mem leak of NSPort and
	  NSConnection objects.


2002-05-09     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added menu option to fetch messages from the local mail spool file
	  if defined by user.
	* Threaded the POP3 accounts fetching in LocalInboxWindowController.
	* ReceivingViewController: The verification for an active connection
	  when editing an incoming mail server account is now performed before
	  the editing window is shown. The verification is now also perfomed
	  when deleting an account.
	* Added support for the "Close" menu item.


2002-05-09     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Minor UI improvements in TransportMethodEditorWindow.
	* Refactored the code in EditWindowController and BounceWindowController
	  to manage the PantomimeStopException quite well.
	* Did the same thing to LocalInboxWindowController.
	* Added a bugfix for POP3 accounts that we wanted to verify mails on
	  startup.
	* Fixed a mem leak in EditWindowController and BounceWindowController by
	  moving the creation of the NSConnection object just before the thread and
	  we now invalidate and destroy the NSConnection when the thread is about to
	  exit.


2002-05-08     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Changed MailIcon_retrieve.tiff
	* Updated Project Builder file.
	* Fixed some errors under OS X with ReceivingWindow (nib and controller).
	* Improved MailboxesView.nib.

	
2002-05-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed FilterManager: -matchedFolderNameFromMessage: type:
	  to expect URLName and no longer just folder names for the name
	  of the folders for the target filters.
	* Refactored the filter code (and parts of the code that was using it!)
	  to support IMAP folders as targets for filters.
	* Added a fix to GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching due to the recent
	  changes for INBOXFOLDERNAME that is now a URLName string and no longer
	  simply the name of the folder (and we were assuming that it was local only).
	* Removed the option to transfer deleted mail to a trash folder when compacting
	  an IMAP folder.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -_updateSizeLabel to show the number of chars
	  in an E-Mail. Suggestion from George Lippert <glipper1@san.rr.com>.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -_replaceSignature to update the status label
	  after changing the signature.
	* Updated IMAPView.nib
	* Updated EditWindow.nib to make the size label larger


2002-05-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added some more ConsoleWindow messages.
	* We now right-align labels in EditWindow.
	* Added a new Preferences panel - Mailboxes. It allows the user
	  to graphically select which mailbox he/she wants to use as the
	  default Inbox/Outbox/Drafts/Trash. Also moved the 
	  "Compact Mailbox on close" option from the Receiving Preferences
	  panel to this one. 
	  More work needs to be done. It actually doesn't save the selection
	  and also doesn't show the IMAP mailboxes.
	* Minor refactor in Utilities.m
	* Fixed some minor UI issues in FindWindow.
	* Added the class FolderNodePopUpItem.
	* Refactored A LOT of code to implement the new Mailboxes Preferences panel.
	  Moved a lot of code from FilterEditorWindowController to Utilities so
	  we can use it in MaiboxesViewController.
	  More changes will be commited soon to ensure maximum stability.
	  You SHOULD NOT use your filters for now.
	* Added the FolderNodePopUpItem class to the OS X project file.
	* Added MaiboxesView.nib and modified the OS X project file to
	  include the Mailboxes target (new).
	* Modified FilterEditorWindow.nib and PreferencesWindow.nib
	* Updated ReveivingView.nib
	* Modified all classes that were posting distributed notifications
	  to store the console message in the userInfo dictionary instead
	  of using the object parameter since on OS X, it doesn't work.

	* Modified the OS X project file to include the Mailboxes target
	  in the "Everything" target
	* Improved the stability of MailboxesViewController and 
	  FilterEditorWindowController.
	

2002-05-06     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added list of incoming mail servers in menu "Get New Mail".
	  Not fully implemented yet.
	

2002-05-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Very minor modifications in MailWindowController that could lead
	  to memory leaks in case of weird errors.
	* Fixed a segfault in EditWindowController: -_replaceSignature.
	  We were autoreleasing an autoreleased object. This bug would occur
	  if your signature was from the content of a file.
	* Added two new icons: Magnifier.tiff and MailIcon_mailboxes.tiff. Those
	  two icons come from YPMail.app which in turns, comes directly from
	  NeXT's Mail.app as far I can tell. There might be some copyright issues.
	  If we had some, we'll just remove them :-)
	* Re-implemented entirely GNUMail: -restoreDraft. We can now fully restore
	  draft messages from IMAP or Local folders.
	* Added more debugging output used in the ConsoleWindow.
	* We now sort the items in the "Get New Mail" menu.
	* Added GNUMail: -showAboutPanel that is only compiled and used on OS X.
	* Modified MainMenu.nib to use the new -showAboutPanel method and also
	  to link missing outlets.
	* Again, added more debugging output used in the ConsoleWindow.



2002-05-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated ReceivingView.nib
	* Added an #ifndef MACOSX in ReceivingViewController: -updateServersList
	  since removing the volatile domain was causing a segfault on OS X. Also
	  added this #ifndef in PreferencesWindowController: -initWithWindowNibName.
	* Updated FilterEditorWindow.nib
	* Modified slightly FilterEditorWindow.m to align some widgets.
	* ReceivingWindow and it's views are now fully resizable under GNUstep.


2002-05-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ReceivingView/ReceivingViewController and 
          LocalInboxWindowController to allow the user to show or not show
          the "No New Messages" alert panels shown after we have verified
          for new messages on a POP3 server and none are new. The new
          user's preferences value is: SHOW_NO_NEW_MESSAGES_PANEL.
	* We now use a local autorelease pool in FilterManager:
	  -matchedFilterForMessage and -matchExistsForFilter: message:
	* Modified IMAPView/IMAPViewController so that the double click
	  action on the outlineview initiates a subscribe/unsubscribe 
	  operation.
	* Modified ReceivingWindow so that it is resizable. More work
	  needs to be done to IMAPView and POP3View.
	* Reworked A LOT filter manager so that we can now use the 2nd
	  and the 3rd criterias.
	* Optimized drastically EditWindowController: -_plainTextContentFromTextView.
	* Fixed a bug in EditWindowController: -updateMessageContentFromTextView:.
	  We were NOT setting the Content-Transfer-Encoding to NONE when setting
	  the Content-Type to @"multipart/mixed". This would cause a problem
	  when fowarding a plain/text message using QP and then after inserting
	  a attachment. Pantomime will QP encode everything, even the base64 encode
	  parts - thus generating a borken message.
	* Also optimized drastically EditWindowController: -updateMessageContentFromTextView.
	* Modified EditWindowController, BounceWindowController and EditWindowController
	  to allow to handle "properly" a stop transfer request from the user. More
	  work needs to be done.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -openIMAPFolderWithName: store: to
	  show a wait panel when opening an IMAP folder.
	  NOTE that more commits are to come to MAKE THINGS MORE STABLE.


2002-05-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ALL filtering related classes to add support for
	  an external program to process the received mails and also
	  to support up to 3 criterias. More work needs to be done (
	  criteria 2 & 3 are ignored for now, we only process the mail
	  before the criterias are applied, etc..) but the good core
	  is there now.


2002-05-03     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified PreferencesWindowController.m, ReceivingViewController.m,
	  ReceivingWindowController.m,
	  TransportMethodEditorWindowController.m,
	  PersonalViewController.m so that absolutely NO preferences are
	  written if the user cancels his/her modifications.
	* Modified ReceivingWindowController.m so that it's no longer
	  possible to modify a server for which there's an active
	  connection.
	

2002-05-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed Utilities: +xCoordOfViewAfter: withSpace: and
	  Utilities: +yCoordOfViewBelow: withSpace: viewHeight:
	* Removed RAWSourceWindow / RAWSourceWindowController since
	  we now display the raw content of the message in the 
	  text view used to display the decoded message.
	* Added the possibility to have the Drafts/Outbox/Trash folders
	  on an IMAP server. Modified a ton of classes to allow this and
	  refactored some code. There's still some work to do for
	  restoring messages from the Draft folder on an IMAP server
	  (Restore Draft is currently 'disabled') and the filters won't
	  work for a Trash folder on an IMAP server (for now).
	* Removed English.lproj/RAWSourceWindow.nib
	* Updated the OS X project file to remove references to the
	  RAWSourceWindow.nib/RAWSourceWindowController class.
	* Fixed a small bug in GNUMail: -showRAWSource. We now enforce
	  a fixed pitch font.


2002-05-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a new option in the filtering window to be able to
	  verify if From/To/Cc/To or Cc is in the address book and
	  do a specific action depending on that.
	* Added a Show Read / Hide Read menu item in the Mailbox and
	  modified the GNUMailConstants and GNUMail classes to implement
	  the desired behavior.
	* Modified ViewingView/ViewingViewController/MailboxManagerController
	  so that it's now possible to specify if we want to hide or show
	  the read messages when we open a folder (by default).
	* Added ConsoleWindow.nib and also added the ConsoleWindowController class
	  to the OS X project.
	* Modified MainMenu.nib and ViewingView.nib to add the new options.
	* Modified AddressBookWindow, AddressBookController and some other classes
	  in order to provide a LDIF import filter. We now support OPENSTEP Mail.app
	  and LDIF. Refactored some code so everything works better.
	* Updated AddressBookWindow.nib


2002-05-01     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified ReceivingWindowController: -okClicked:
	  If a server name or username is changed, the associated
	  cache files are now renamed.


2002-04-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the ConsoleWindow/ConsoleWindowController classes. This
	  is the initial implementation of the GNUMail.app Console.


2002-04-28     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added EditWindowController: -_adjustNextKeyViews and we now
	  use this method on both GNUstep and OS X.
	* Modified EditWindow.nib to set the next key view of the subject
	  field to the content of the message (the text view).


2002-04-27     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Completely rewritten the Fonts Preferences panel. Needs some
          optimizations - especially since NSPopUpButton under GNUstep is
	  *very* slow.
        * Changed the version number to 1.0.4 in GNUMailConstants.m
	* Updated FontsView.nib and modifed FontsViewController. so it works
	  better under OS X.
	* Adjusted ComposeView.m so that the charset popup is bigger.


2002-04-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Set the CVS tag to v1_0_1
        * RELEASED v1.0.1.


2002-04-26     Erik Daln <dalen@jpl.se>

	* Updated Swedish translation

2002-04-25     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Improved behaviour of MailboxManager when opening mailboxes.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -deleteMessage to update the
	  cache when deleted messages are not visible.
	* Modified GNUMail: -showOrHideDeletedMessages to update the
	  status bar.
	* Improved addressbook to/cc/bcc icons.
	* Improved AddressBook.nib, MimeTypeEditorWindow.nib.


2002-04-25     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated Spanish translation. Patch from
	  Quique <quique@sindominio.net>.
	* Modified ReceivingWindowController (and IMAPViewController) to
	  set the default fetching delay to 1 minute instead of 10 minutes
	  for IMAP connections.
	* Commented some NSLog() calls.
	* Modified GNUMail: -showAllHeaders to use [mailWindowController allMessages]
	  instead of [[mailWindowController folder] allMessages] to fix a problem
	  when deleted messages are hidden.
	* Done the same thing in GNUMail: -markMessageAsReadOrUnread.
	* Fixed some errors in FilterEditorWindow.nib
	* Improved the UI of the Address Book.
	* Fixed a bug in FilteringViewController. We don't draw the cell bg color
	  if the filter's action isn't SET_COLOR.
	* Changed the custom class in FilterView.nib for the table view.
	* Fixed a bug in the Sending bundle. We verify if the password isn't
	  nil before setting the value to the text field.


2002-04-24     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added backspace key support in ExtendedWindow for Mac OS X.
	* Improved DnD support over the MailboxManager.
	* Fixed columns order in IMAPView nib.


2002-04-24     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Changed the icon in the PasswordPanel from a NSButton to
	  a NSImageView.
	* Added an icon in NewMailboxPanel.
	* Added an icon in NewPersonalProfilePanel.
	* Renamed MailWindowController: -showSizes / -setShowSizes
	  to -showStatusBar / -setShowStatusBar and also the
	  ivar showSizes to showStatusBar.
	* Fixed a bug in MailboxManagerController: -delete. We remove
	  the IMAP cache files IIF the Store is an IMAPStore. This fixes
	  a segfault we were getting when deleting a LocalFolder.
	* Fixed the (c) notice in ExtendedTableView.
	* Regenerated the Localizable.strings files for English and French.
	* Fixed missing outlet connection in MainMenu.nib
	* Fixed IMAPMailWindow.nib (set the ExtendedTableView custom class
	  and the autoresizing masks on the "lock" icon).


2002-04-23     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Filtering bundle: renamed class ExtendedTableView to
	  ExtendedFilteringTableView.
	* Many improvements in many nibs ..

2002-04-23     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManager.m to include the new copy/move icons.
	* Updated docs/WHOIS
	* Modified Utilities: +bestRepresentationFromMultipartAlternative: so that
 	  we verify we REALLY got a valid NSString object from Pantomime (since
	  Pantomime might returns the raw source of the message, a NSData object,
	  if the decoding operation has failed).
	* Fixed two bugs so that we now refresh our MailboxManagerCache properly
	  when the folder is compacted.
	* Commented some debugging infoz in MailboxManagerCache.m.
	* Modified MailboxManager.m to remove the horizontal scrollbar in the 
	  outline view and also modified MailboxManagerController to right-align
	  the Size/Messages cell values.
	* Renamed "Hide/Show Sizes" to "Hide/Show Status Bar".


2002-04-22     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Improved verification when appending messages in DnD, copy, cut,
	  and paste.
	* Improved NewPersonalProfilePanel nib.
	* Improved NewMailboxPanel nib.
	* Improved mailbox manager icons.
	* Added icons for DnD.


2002-04-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Moved MimeTypeManager to a singleton. Modified a lot of classes that was using
	  the previous "model" to now use the singleton. This includes: Utilities, 
	  MailWindowController, EditWindowController and others.
	* Refactored a little bit GNUMail.m
	* Fixed two compiler warnings in MailWindowController: -updateStatusLabel.
	* Added some TODO items that will be implemented in the next release.
	* Fixed a bug in MailboxManagerController: -outlineView: willDisplayCell: ...
	  to correctly set the default font if our item doesn't represent a folder
	  containing unread messages.
	* Removed the Open button in the MailboxManager.
	* Moved the Delete button in the MailboxManager.


2002-04-21     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Corrected a bug in IMAPMailWindowController:
          -_transferMessagesToTrashFolder and refactored this method
          to use the new MailboxManagerController method to transfer
          messages.
	* Refactored MailboxManagerController: -transferMessageFromRawSource:..
	  to accept a folder parameter so that this method won't search for one
	  and won't close it when it's finished. Also modified it to partially update
	  the cache of the MailboxManager and to return a BOOL (YES on success).
	  Modified all the classes that were using the previous methods. 
	* Repaced all "[aFolder appendMessageFromRawSource: ...]" method calls by
	  the refactored method MailboxManagerController: -transferMessageFromRawSource:...
	* Modified EditWindowController to set the EditWindow non-resizable for now.
	* Added a call to setDataSource: nil on the MailboxManager's outlineView in
	  MailboxManagerController: -dealloc to prevent a potential segfault under OS X.
	* We now show the username in the alert panel saying that there's no new messages
	  on the POP3 server in LocalInboxMailWindowController.
	* We now save (and restore) the column sizes in the Mailbox Manager.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -transferMessageFromRawSource:... to use
	  the new Pantomime Folder methods -numberOfUnreadMessages and -size.
	* Added a new, surely temporary, Filtering.tiff icon.
	* Modified NewMailboxPanel, NewMailboxPanelController and MailboxManagerController
	  to set the window title and the label used in NewMailboxPanel to right strings
	  when editing.
	* Modified NewMailboxPanel.nib to link the label outlet.
	* Fixed a bug in MailboxManagerController: -initializeIMAPStoreWithKey. We were
	  asking for stringValue on a NSNumber object when we really wanted to call -intValue.


2002-04-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added support for multiple accounts (POP3/IMAP) for the same server.
          Patch from Francis Lachapelle slightly modified by myself.
	* Fixed the memory leak generated in GNUMail: -changeTextEncoding.


2002-04-19     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManagerController: -setStore: name: username:
	  to properly collapse the IMAP folder node (the root one for 
	  specific IMAP server) when closing the connection to the IMAP store.
	* We now save the tableview's colums size/position in the userdefaults
	  for MailWindow, LocalInboxWindow and IMAPMailWindow.
	* Cleaned the TODO.
	* Reversed the order of all loops for pasting/dropping a selection of
	  messages to respect the initial order.
	* Resized some UI elements in BounceWindow.m
	* Made minor UI adjustments to the move/copy buttons in MailboxManager.m
	* Fixed an autoresizing issue for the charset UI elements in
	  EditWindow.m (more fixes to come for the rest of the UI elements).
	* Removed the [[self window] update] call for updateAnimatedIcon: methods.


2002-04-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the class MailboxManagerCache. This class manage the
	  cache used to display the total size / nb of messages /
	  nb of unread messages in the MailboxManager's outline view.
	  The cache is NOT initially build for existing mailboxes but
	  will rather be once it is opened. There's still more work to
	  do like when mails are transferred (by copy/paste/dnd, etc),
	  the cache won't always be updated. That was TODO #155. Updated
	  MailWindowController and MailboxManagerController to make use
	  of the cache.
	* Removed TODO #194 (search in content of messages) since that
	  was done by Francis on 2002-04-17.
	* Removed the Cancel button in BounceWindow and modified the 
	  controller to swap the "Send" icon by the "Stop" icon when
	  the send operation is going on.
	* Fixed a bug in MailWindowController: -updateStatusLabel when
	  we were obtaining the IMAP username for a specific store.
	* Added an import to MailboxManagerController.m to avoid some
	  compiler warnings.
	* Added the MailboxManagerCache to the OS X project file.
	* Removed the Cancel button from BounceWindow.nib
	* Fixed an autoresizing bug for the spinning icon in
	  LocalInboxWinndow.nib
	* Added a small fix to FilteringViewController to avoid
	  a compiler warning.


2002-04-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ComposeView/ComposeViewController and EditWindow/
	  EditWindowController to use the new MimeUtility: -allCharsets
	  method.
	* Implemented GNUMail: -updateTextEncodingsMenu.
	* Implemented GNUMail: -changeTextEncoding. This methods needs more
	  work for the "Default" and "iconv" selection.
	* Fixed a little bit GNUMail: -changeTextEncoding. Needs more work
	  for iconv. Also rewrote -updateTextEncodingsMenu.
	* Removed the CREATE_AUTORELEASE_POOL macro from GNUMailConstants.h
	* Removed the "Cancel" button in EditWindow. Also improved the UI and
	  modified EditWindowController to show a "Stop" icon instead of the
	  "Send" icon when sending an email. You can't stop it right now.
	* Corrected a small menu index bug in GNUMail.m
	* Fixed two @ bugs (one in Utilities, one in MailboxManagerController)

	  disabled by default.
	* Modified the GNUMail class to allow the user to specify
	  an other text encoding to use for the selected message.
	  The "logic" of all this needs to be implemented in Pantomime.
	  Added the UI items and the action methods.
	* Added the skeleton for the method GNUMail: -changeTextEncoding.
	* Refactored a little bit the Utilities class.


2002-04-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a localization bug in PreferencesWindowController:
	  -_initializeModuleWithName: atIndex:.
	* Fixed the size of MailIcon_addresses.tiff.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController: -messagesWereReceived
	  to synchronize our cache for our local folder after receiving
	  a number of messages for it.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController to swap the "Get" icon to
	  the stop hand and swap it back when we're done downloading mails.
	  You can't stop the thread right.
	* Modified GNUMail.m to remove deprecated preference values.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController to also show the username
	  in the window title of the PasswordPanel.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -controlTextDidChange to set
	  the subject to "no subject" if the subject field becomes empty.

	  checkbox.
	* Modified IMAPMailWindow.nib to add the 'secure' NSImageView
	  for displaying the little lock icon when using IMAP over SSL.
	* Modified PersonalViewController: -changePersonalSelection so
	  that we now verify if keys (SIGNATURE/SIGNATURE_SOURCE) exist
	  in the dictionary before trying to set any values to either
	  the field or the popup. Otherwise, we can put nil as the content
	  of the field and Cocoa complains about it.


2002-04-14     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities.m to use lossyCString instead of cString when
          we strip the html codes.
	* Modified GNUMail: -selectionOfMessageHasChanged to verify for nil
	  values (for the InternetAddress object as string) before adding
	  an NSMenuItem for it.
	* Added a missing comma


2002-04-13     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now display in IMAPMailWindow a little "lock" if we are using
          a SSL/IMAP connection. Added Icons/pgp-mail-small.tiff.
	* Fixed autoresizing mask on this little "lock" icon.
	* Added SSL support for POP3 connections.
	* Refactored a little bit GNUMail.m

	* Added autosave position (and size) to all windows.
	* Added a new fonts icon (fonts.tiff) for the Fonts Preferences panel made
	  by myself.


2002-04-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Done TODO #202. We now offer the option to apply filters
	  manually (on the last mail window on top, selected messages).
	  This needs some more work but most of it is there now.
	* Refactored some code to make use of MailboxManagerController:
 	  -transferMessageFromRawSource: flags: toFolderName: store:
	  and also refactored this method.
	* Refactored EditWindowController: -messageWasSentFromRAWSource:
	  to use that method too.
	* Refactored GNUMail: -saveInDrafts to use this method.
	* Added some new icons. Modified docs/README and the plist
	  for the (c) notice. 
	* Changed MailWindow for ExtendedWindow (in GNUMail.m, the
	  copy & paste code) since under OS X, MailWindow isn't compiled
	  but ExtendedWindow is - it's the custom class of all "MailWindows".
	* Modified ReceivingWindow/ReceivingWindowController to allow a new
	  option: "Use secure connection (SSL)". Modified MailboxManagerController
	  to allow secure (SSL) IMAP connections. POP3 and SMTP aren't done yet.
	* Modified IMAPViewController to use a SSL connection when the option
	  is activated in the ReceivingWindow for subscribing/unsubscribing to
	  IMAP folders.


2002-04-12     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added method checkForUpdates in GNUMail.m (currenlty only
	  available under Mac OS X).
	* Added support for cut, copy, and paste of messages between
	  mailboxes (with both MailWindow's and the MailboxManager).


2002-04-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added FilterManager: -matchedFolderNameFromMessage and refactored
	  -matchedFolderNameFromMessageAsRawSource to use the new method
	  so that it'll ease the process of applying filters to messages that
	  have already been initialized.
	* Finished the support for outgoing filters. Removed TODO #240.
	* Modified ReceivingWindow/ReceivingWindowController to be able to
	  specify if we want to verify for new mail on GNUMail.app startup.
	* Done TODO #214. Modified LocalInboxWindowController and
	  MailboxManagerController to allow mail verification on startup.
	* Corrected a declaraction bug in MailboxManagerController for
	  gcc < 3.
	* Modified all controller classes in the Preferences Panel that was
	  using NSTableView objects to set the dataSource to nil so that
	  we don't get a segfault under OS X.
	* Replaced [[self window] performClose: nil] simply by [self close]
	  in ReceivingWindowController: -cancelClicked.
	* Updated ReceivingWindow.nib and FilterEditorWindow.nib to add 
	  new UI elements.


2002-04-11     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified move/copy handling in MailboxManager.


2002-04-11     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the filtering code to be able to specify that
	  a filter is an incoming or outgoing one.
	* Refactored entirely the filter management code (the matching
	  algorithm) and moved most of the code out of LocalInboxWindowController
	  to MailboxManagerController and FilterManager.


2002-04-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added ExtendedWindow to the OS X project file.
	* Modified IMAPMailWindow.nib, LocalInboxWindow.nib and
 	  MailWindow.nib to set the knob type of the splitview
	  to = and also set the custom class of the window
	  to ExtendedWindow.
	* Modified Utilities to use the NSWorkspace to get the icon
	  for a specific (and unknown) file type. Also removed an extra
	  RELEASE() that wasn't supposed to be there!
	* Added the Welcome message to the OS X ressource files in the
	  PB project for the GNUMail target..
	* Added two access/mutation methods to MailWindowController to set
	  and get the current and the previous sorting order. Modified the
	  code in MailWindowController.m to use those methods. This should
	  fix all the mem leaks the previous solution was causing and the
	  segfaults on OS X.
	* Modified BounceWindow.nib, EditWindow.nib, IMAPMailWindow.nib,
	  LocalInboxWindow.nib,  MailWindow.nib, NewAddressPanel.nib,
	  NewMailboxPanel.nib, PasswordPanel.nib, RAWSourceWindow.nib and
	  PreferencesWindow.nib to NOT be visible at launch time and 
	  be released when closed.
	* Done the same thing for: NewPersonalProfilePanel.nib,
	  TransportMethodEditorWindow.nib, ReceivingWindow.nib,
	  MailcapWindow, MimeTypeEditorWindow.nib, FilterEditorWindow.nib,
	  FilterHeaderEditorWindow.nib and FilterMessageWindow.nib.  


2002-04-10     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Refactored EditWindowController -_recipientsFromString:.
	* Added support for backspace and delete keys in ExtendedWindow.

2002-04-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -tableView: acceptDrop: ...
	  to catch the possible raised exeception when appending a message
	  to a folder using DnD.


2002-04-09     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail.m to set the initial tag to our showAllHeaders
	  menu item.
	* Updated the Welcome message.
	* Modified GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching: to use the
	  Welcome mbox if it's the first time GNUMail.app is started.
	  The content of the default Inbox will be the content of the
	  Welcome mbox. This completes TODO #220.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController to return an empty string
	  for the Size/Messages column instead of dummy value.
	* Modified EditWindow to set the autoresizing mask to the 
	  charset popup button.

	  menu item (default value after startup).


2002-04-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified FilterEditorWindow/FilterEditorWindowController to make
	  the colors much more nicer to your eyes :) 
	  Those colors were suggested Rob Burns <rburns@softhome.net>.
	* Done TODO #252. Added /etc/mime.types support to MimeTypeManager
	  and refactored the code to be table-driven.
	* Added Goodies/Welcome. This is a simple mailbox containing the
	  welcome message that we'll show to each new GNUMail.app user.
	  This file will be store in the Resources directory.
	* Modified the FilteringViewController to use our own custom
	  NSButtonCell so we can draw properly its background color
	  (currently broken under GNUstep). Also fixed some bugs in
	  FilterEditorWindowController.
	* Modified IMAPMailWindow.nib to set the delegate of the
	  window to the controller.
	* Updated the Welcome message.
	* Fixed the segfault that occurred when a message was being sent

        * Refactored ALL the code related to FolderNode objects and
          path handling for them. It is now way more simple and coherent.
	* Fixed some bugs in folder separator handling. It should now work
	  way better with any kind of path separator (/, ., or something
	  else). There is still some issues about selecting the right
	  folder after a specific operation (like create, delete or rename).
	* Added some fixes for the selection bug.
	* Fixed the selection bug by expanding the nodes from the root to the
	  children and not the other way around.
	* Changed the GNUMail.app framework into a Library only under GNUstep. 
	

2002-04-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController and its subclasses so that the
          -initWithWindowNib name is optimized under OS X. We don't
          do post-init stuff many times under OS X anymore (nor under
          GNUstep).
	* Modified EditWindow.nib to set the delegate of the
	  text fields (To/Cc/Bcc/Subject) and the text view to
	  the controller object.
	* Moved the code in GNUMail: -init to -applicationDidFinishLaunching.
	* Small fixes to the Clock bundle so that everything compiles and links
	  under OS X.
	* Done some minor refactoring in FilteringViewController and
	  MailWindowController.


2002-04-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the OS X project file to include the Pantomime framework
	  when compiling the Compose bundle.
	* Modified Utilities: +formattedAttributedStringFromAttributedString:
	  so that we verify that the cell really responds to the "part"
	  selector before trying to extract the filename out of it. This
	  should fix the problem with HTML mails under OS X.
	* Updated ComposeView.nib
	* Updated EditWindow.nib
	* Updaded the plist and the OS X project file to set the version number
	  to 1.0.1.


2002-04-05     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	  mailbox manager (MacOS X only -- for now)


2002-04-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: +folderNodeForPath: using: to
	  return the root node if the path is representing the
	  root node. We were returning nil before.
	* Modified the MailboxManagerController to expand the
	  root node (and the Local root node) in -reloadAllFolders
	  instead of -initWithNibName.
	* Added an access method to the mailboxNameField of
	  NewMailboxPanelController. Modified -windowWillClose
	  to not autorelease the instance and modified MailboxManagerController
	  to release the NewMailboxPanelController instances when done with them.
	* Added consistency the the way nodes are selected and expanded when
	  a new one is added (or renamed or deleted) in the MailboxManagerController.
	* Corrected a bug in NewMailboxPanelController: -okClicked. We weren't adding
	  the pathSeparator (currently fixed at @"/") between our path to the mailbox
	  and out mailbox name.
	* Fixed some bugs when we were addding or renaming IMAP folders.
	* Fixed a bug in Utilities: +folderNodesFromFolders: separator:
	* Fixed a lot of bugs related to renaming Folders/Sub-Folders in
	  NewMailboxWindowController: -okClicked:.
	* Added the possibility to specify a default charset used when sending
	  messages. Added a user's option in the ComposeView Preferences panel and also
	  a user's option in the EditWindow. The default charset (or the selected one)
	  will be used ONLY if the final content isn't an ASCII string.


2002-04-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Bundles/PGP/.cvsignore
	* Modified all .cvsignore files to include shared_debug_obj

        * Renamed Utilities: +folderNodesFromFolders to
	  +folderNodesFromFolders: separator: and modified the
	  code everywhere that was using this method.
	* Refactored PreferencesWindowController to avoid compiler
	  warnings and also to support the loading of Preferences panels
	  from application bundles.
	* Provided an initial implementation of the PGP bundle. Added
	  the skeleton of classes w/o any real logic. This bundle should NOT
	  be packaged right now.
	* Applied a patch from Adam Fedor so that if GNUMail.app is build with
	  debugging symbols, we can properly load the bundles.
	* Small changes to NewMailboxPanelController to remove some debug logs
	  and to fix some annoying compiler warnings.


2002-04-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Specified the tag values for the matrix in viewing view.
	* Modified FilterEditorWindowController to allow hierarchical mbox
	  selection. It now looks pretty and is very usable!
	* Removed Address: -compare:.
	* Fixed NewMailboxPanelController: -okClicked: to correctly rename
	  the IMAP cache when we're renaming an IMAP folder of an IMAP store.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -rename to not try to rename
	  an opened IMAP folder.
	* Modified MailWindowController to remove the category on NSWindow to
	  redefine -keyDown. Added a class instead (ExtendedWindow) and we use
	  this class in MailWindow (and it's subclasses) only. This fix the problem
	  that -keyDown would call wrong selectors in other windows.
	* Modified MailWindowController to make the window the key one (and order it
	  to the front) after showing the PasswordPanel under GNUstep.
	* We now correctly link the icon outlet in MailWindowController under GNUstep.


2002-04-01     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified TransportMethodEditorWindowController: -transportMethodHasChanged:

          added drag and drop support for the table view;
          added tags to cells of columns matrix.
        * Improved all bundles nibs.


2002-04-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed Address: -matchesFilterString: orComponents:

	  to 1.0.1.


2002-04-02     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Added necessary methods to FilteringViewController
	  to support drag'n'drop of filters in table view.

        * Minor UI modifications in the PersonalView.
	* Modified the MailboxManagerController to order-front
	  the window when the modal loop is finished for the
	  add/rename operation for mailboxes.
	* Changed MailboxManagerController -storeForName: to
	  storeForName: username: and also setStore: forName:
	  to setStore: name: username: to allow more than one
	  account per IMAP server. Also modified all classes
	  that were depending on those two methods.
	* Added a "temporary" method in Utilities:
	  +usernameFromServerName:
	* Improved the UI of FilterEditorWindow under GNUstep.
	* Added exception handlers for newly introduced
	  PantomimeFolderAppendMessageException. This exception occurs
	  when a failure occurs when appending a message to a Local or
	  an IMAP folder. Completes TODO #231.


2002-04-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a bug in Utilities: +pathOfFolderFromPath.
	* Reactivated MailboxManagerController: -create, -delete

	* Moved MailWindowController: -_serverNameForIMAPFolderNode:
	  to Utilities: +serverNameForIMAPFolderNode.
	* Refactored MailWindowController to re-use some code when
	  reloading the list of subscribed folders after a create,
	  rename or delete operation.
	* Fixed some bugs in NewMailboxPanelController.
	* Modified IMAPMailWindowController to offer the user the option
	  to close the connection with the IMAP server when the window
	  is about to be close.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController to allow Stores to be removed
	  from the dictionary of opened Stores and also added a verification
	  so that we can't open more than one IMAP folder on the same IMAP
	  Store at the same time.
	* Fixed a #ifdef MACOSX mistake in MailWindowController that would
	  lead us to use the wrong font under GNUstep and OS X.
	* Modified ReceivingViewController: -delete to remove all POP3Cache
	  and IMAPCache files when deleting a server.
	* Modified IMAPViewController: -unsubscribe to remove the cache when
	  we unsubscribe to an IMAP folder.

	* Cleaned FolderNode: -copyWithZone: until the GNUstep's NSOutlineView
	  is unborken.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController: -initializeIMAPStoreWithName to
	  use -reloadItem: under OS X and -reloadData under GNUstep until
	  the NSOutlineView is fixed.
	* Removed a lot of old code in GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching.
	* Removed GNUMail: -localStore. Replaced all this by a more intelligent
	  solution. We now hold a dictionary of all openened stores in
	  MailboxManagerController. Refactored all the code to use this new
	  way of doing things.
	* We now verify in MailboxManagerController: -openOnStartupClicked that
	  our selected folder can be opened on startup.


2002-03-30     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Utilities: +folderNodeForPath: using:

	* Fixed a bug in GNUMail: -showFoldersToOpen that would prevent
	  us to automatically open a folder contained in a subfolder.
	* Removed everything related to "Wait panels". This is gonna be
	  replaced by a more practical solution.
	* Added Utilities: +flattenPathFromString: to replace all occurences

 	* Completely rewrote again all the logic for the outlineView
 	  datasource. Added a new class FolderNode that eases everything.
 	  Removed some unused methods in Utilities. Modified
 	  MailboxManagerController and IMAPViewController to use this
 	  new way of doing things with the outlineView.
	* Commented the deallocation of the IMAPStore in
	  IMAPMailWindowController.
	* Reactivated MailboxManager: -outlineViewSelectionIsChanging:
	* Added comparison support to FolderNode (for sorting) and refactored

	  not show the horizontal scrollbar in the tableView.
	* Modified MailboxManager: -windowDidLoad to set the
	  double action to open: under OS X.
	* Modified PreferencesWindowController:
	  -_initializeModuleWithName: atIndex: to set the button
	  font to size 10 under OS X and 8 under GNUstep.
	

2002-03-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * We now close correctly the connection with the IMAP server
	  and also release the IMAPStore when we close the "Inbox"
	  folder on an IMAP server. That's a temporary solution that
	  will be replaced by a better one once we support multiple
	  IMAP folders on the same server.
	* Modified MailWindowController (and its two subclasses) to retain
	  the table columns under OS X (and release them in
	  MailWindowController: -dealloc).


2002-03-22	Martin Brecher <martin@gnustep.de>

	* Updated German translation


2002-03-22     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Added missing localization strings in POP3View,
 	  MailboxManager and TransportMethodEditorWindow. 
        * Regenerated all Localizable.strings files.
	* Updated the french translation.


2002-03-22	Martin Brecher <martin@gnustep.de>

	* Updated German translation


2002-03-21     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Various corrections in most Mac OS X nibs.
	* Various improvements in Project Builder file.

2002-03-21     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated docs/WHOIS
	* Reactivated MailWindowController: -receivingValuesHaveChanged.
	  This will currently cause a segfault if you modify your preferences
	  values and the MailboxManager is opened. It will be fixed
	  in GNUstep gui 0.7.6. 


2002-03-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified PreferencesWindowController:
          _instanceForBundleWithName: to not use "Apps" anymore
          since it's not required to have a recent version of 
          GNUstep and Apps has been renamed to Applications.


2002-03-20     Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Many improvements in Project Builder file.
	* Changed search paths for bundles under MacOS X in 
	  PreferencesWindowController.m.


2002-03-20     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Localized some strings in the Personal panel.
	* Resized some of the UI widgets in the Preferences panel
	* Aligned all the fields in the Personal panel.
	* Resized some UI elements in the Fonts panel.
	* Set the margins of the 'signature box' to 0,0 in the
	  Personal panel.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController: -messageWasReceived:
 	  folderName: to set this method as "oneway void" and not
	  "void" so the thread won't block when calling this method.
	* Modified again the UI of most windows so that it looks more
          consistent, especially when using AA fonts under GNUstep.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -setFolder to select the
	  first message and not the last one if the order is reversed
	  when we open the folder.
	* Finished TODO #193. We now offer basic filters capabilities.
	  The "Expert" feature has been added.
	* Modified Utilities.m so that when we write the content of
	  a part to a file (for image/*), we convert the filename
	  to a lowercase string. Otherwise, libwraster is lame enough
	  to not recognize the format.
	* Updated Personal.nib to include the "Set this profile as default"
	  check box.
	* Updated LocalInboxWindow.nib to set the resizing attributes to
	  the rotating icon.


2002-03-19     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Done TODO #219. It's now possible to define a default personal
          profile from the Personal Preferences panel.

        
2002-03-18     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added MimeTypeManager: -bestMimeTypeForFileExtension:
 	  to provide a set of default MIME types in case the user
	  hasn't specified on for the file extension.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -updateMessageContentFromTextView
	  to use this new method.
	* Added a patch from Vicent Ricard for TODO #244. It's now possible
	  to {Shift/Control} double-click in the Address Book window to
	  set the Cc/Bcc fields.
	* Added MailWindowController: -doubleClickedOnTableView so that when
	  we double-click on the tableView in MailWindow, if we are in the
	  Drafts folder, we re-open the message for editing. Otherwise, we
	  simply open the message for a 'reply'. Done TODO #250.
	* Modified PreferencesWindowController to avoid compilation warnings
	  under OS X.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindow.nib to fix the nib connection for the 
	  Get button.
	* Modified PasswordPanel.nib to remove the extra controller object.
	* Did the same thing with AddressBookWindow.nib, FindWindow.nib,
	  IMAPMailWindow.nib, MailWindow.nib, NewAddressPanel.nib, 
	  NewMailboxPanel.nib, and RAWSourceWindow.nib.
	* Modified the OS X project file to set the version number to 1.0.0. 
	  Also modified the InfoPlist.strings file for the same reason.
        * Modified LocalInboxWindowController: -threadWillExit to restart
	  the timer only if we need to!
	* Done TODO #226. Applied a patch from Vincent Ricard (modified
	  by myself so that we don't create a category for NSTableView but
	  rather NSWindow and we put everything in the controller, not the
	  view).

 
2002-03-17     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailboxManager to set the autoresizing mask
          of the "Open this folder on startup" button.
	* Modified the OS X project file to remove any references to
	  the Quoting nib.
	* Updated MailboxManager.nib
	* Modified the Sending target to include the Pantomime framework.
	* Updated PreferencesWindow.nib
	* Updated ViewingView.nib
	* Updated ComposeView.nib
	* Updated TransportMethodEditorWindow.nib
	* Updated FontsView.nib
	* Updated FilteringView.nib
	* Modified the project file to include all anim icons.
	* Updated LocalInboxWindow.nib
	* Updated BounceWindow.nib
	* Updated EditWindow.nib


2002-03-16     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Done TODO #238. It's now possible to any folder on statup of
          GNUMail.app. It's now possible to have an IMAP folder as the
          default folder upon GNUMail.app's startup. Modified many files
          to support this and mainly refactored MailboxManagerController.
	* Commented the code in MailboxManagerController:
	  -receivingValuesHaveChanged since -reloadData doesn't work yet
	  in NSOutlineView it'll cause a segfault. 
	* Refactored the UI of the Viewing panel to be able to specify
	  which table columns we want to see in the MailWindow's tableView.
	  It does nothing for now.
	* Done TODO #239. It's now possible to specify which table 
	  headers we want to see in the MailWindow. Modified ViewingView,
	  ViewingViewController, PreferencesWindowController and
	  all MailWindowController subclasses (and the class itself) to
	  support this new feature. The set of visible table columns is 
	  saved in the user's defaults with the key: SHOWNTABLECOLUMNS.


2002-03-15     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified BounceWindowController and EditWindowController
	  to not prompt for a password if the SMTP server doesn't use
	  SMTP AUTH.


2002-03-14     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Done TODO #236. Added a patch from Vincent Ricard to
	  to the addresses/groups in the Address book.
	* Modified EditWindowController and BounceWindowController to
	  support SMTP AUTH (prompt a password and more)
	* Modified TransportMethod* to add new fields for gettting
	  the supported SMTP AUTH mechanism, to choose one, to save or
	  not the password in the user defaults and more.


2002-03-13     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindowController: 
	  -errorOccuredWhenSendingMessageForOutboxFolder
	  to stop the timer (when an error occurs).


2002-03-12     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the MailboxManager to inclue a checkbox item to specify
	  if the folder is to be openend upon GNUMail.app's startup. It's
	  currently unused.
	* Added LabelWidget: +labelWidgetWithFrame: label: alignment:
	* Refactored the Fonts panel so it now looks way better. Also
	  renamed all ivars and fixed some memory leaks.


2002-03-10     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController: -tableViewShouldReloadData to
          clear the textView if the number of selected rows in the tableView
          isn't equal to 1. This 'fix' a bug when transferring messages
          between mboxes.
	* Replaced [NSPort port] by [[NSPort alloc] init] (followed by
	  a RELEASE after) to prevent gcc from complaining.
	* Added MailWindowController (Private): _restoreSplitViewSize
	  to restore the size of the textScrollView in the MailWindow
	  (save in the new pref value TEXTSCROLLVIEW_HEIGHT) in order
	  to restore the 'knob' position of the scroll view (TODO #200)
	* Removed the Quoting Preferences panel bundle (merged in
	  the Compose bundle).
	* Refactored A LOT the Preferences panel and its bundles.
	* Finished refactoring for now the Preferences panel!


2002-03-09     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Replaced the Fonts icon in the Preferences panel.
	* Optimized +attributedStringFromContentForPart: mimeTypeManager:
	  to not write to a file attachments that aren't image/* (since
	  we need to do that right now for full libwraster support under
	  GNUstep) and also linked everything to the MimeTypeManager so
	  that one can provide us an icon to use to represent the attachment
	  if the user has defined a MIME type for that kind of attachment.
	* Done TODO #225. We now select and expand automatically our Local
	  folder in the MailboxManager if there's no IMAP stores/folders
	  defined.


2002-03-08     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ReceivingWindowController to load and save the new
	  RETAINPERIOD preference value for POP3 servers.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController to set the retain period
	  on the POP3 folder.
	* Modified Utilities: +attributedStringFromContentForPart: 
	 		       mimeTypeManager:
	  to correctly resize 'data' attachments (like image/*) so that
	  they fit correctly in the text view.
	* Added MailWindowController: _restoreSortingOrder that reads
	  the default SORTINGORDER and uses it to apply an initial sort
	  to the table view on startup. Also selects the right column on
	  startup. Modified LocalInboxWindowController and 
	  IMAPMailWindowController to use this code.
	* We now also save the sorting state in SORTINGSTATE.
	* Modified RAWSourceWindow: -layoutWindow to make the text view
	  not horizontally resizable. GNUstep seems to be confused when
	  we set that attribute.


2002-03-07     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Reactivated sorting and the double-action in the outline view
	  for the MailboxManager.
	* Added a user option in the Viewing preferences panel to allow the
	  user to show or hide deleted messages on GNUMail.app's startup.
	  (TODO #251)
	* Movied MailWindowController: -updateLastMailWindowOnTop to
	  GNUMail: +setLastMailWindowOnTop (same thing with
	  -lastMailWindowOnTop). Update all the code to reflect this change.
	* Added missing animation frame (the 8th one). "Patch" from 
	  Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>.
	  Modified the code to use this 8th frame.
	* Added the matrix outlet in FindWindowController for future usage.
	* Added the 'days' field in POP3View (but not yet implement the
	  functionnality. Fixed a mem leak too.


2002-03-06     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindowController: -updateMessageContentFromTextView
	  to return the last path component of the filename for the 
	  attachment instead of the full path.
	* Rewrote MailboxManager/MailboxManagerController to use a
	  NSOutlineView instead of a NSBrowser (TODO #252). You need
	  to use a recent CVS version of GNUstep in order to use it
	  (version of 2002/03/06 or more recent). Also, there's issues
	  when you create/delete/rename mailboxes due to bugs in
	  NSOutlineView.


2002-03-05     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Rewrote entirely the LocalMailDelivery class (the important
	  parts) to speed up things a lot and to also use way less
	  memory for everything.


2002-03-04     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified LocalInboxWindowController to stop the automatic
	  fetching timer (before starting the thread) and to restart
	  it when the thread is about to exit. This is to avoid
	  racing conditions and potential deadlocks.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -setPlainTextContentFromString:
	  inPart: to reactivate the support of format=flowed parts.
	* Modified ExtendedTableView.m to remove the use 
	  of NSMiddleMouseDraggedMask.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController so that we verify if our
	  thread isn't running before closing the window. If it does run,
	  we simply inform the user to wait.
	* Added a quick fix to LocalMailDelivery: -messagesFromMailspoolFile
	  so it now works again since the Pantomime's modifications about
	  8bit messages support.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController: so that we use
	  DESTROY(animation) instead of TEST_RELEASE(animation).


2002-03-03     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added multithreading support in BounceWindowController.
	* Modified some parts of the code to allow GNUMail.app to work
	  well with the new Pantomime's code for 8bit support for messages.

        
2002-03-02     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified LocalInboxWindowController to set the animation delay
          to 0.1s and also to call the update method on the controller's
          window after setting the new icon.
	* We now disable the Get button before initiating the fetch
	  and we re-enable it when the thread is about to exit.
	* Added multithreading support when sending messages. This support
	  is not yet completed (ie., it won't work if you click on Cancel
	  while the E-Mail is being sent) but it should work well.
	* Modified the bundle loading code in PreferencesWindowController
	  since Apps has been renamed Applications on GNUstep. Kept the
	  previous code for compatibility reasons.
	* We now inform the user (by showing a panel) that he/she must
	  wait until the email has been sent before closing the EditWindow.


2002-03-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Changed the previous implementation to use a NSConnection
          object. Should be safer now.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController: -windowDidLoad
	  to remove our distributed lock if one was there (for example,
	  left after a crash).
	* Added an animated icon for the LocalInboxWindow. The animated
	  icon is a set of tiff files provided by
	  Jeff Teunissen <deek@d2dc.net>.


2002-03-01     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Introduced threads support in LocalInboxWindowController.
	  This temporary solution is using the distributed objects.
	  It only 'shows' that it is possible to do it easily.
	  This solution is TEMPORARY and WILL BE REPLACED by a
	  using a NSConnection in the following days. I do not 
	  recommand to use GNUMail.app with that code, even if it
	  should work perfectly (minus the fact that you must wait
	  the DO server to send you all your messages). This currently
	  makes heavy use of notifications but, this will all go away
	  in the next following days so don't complain to me about
	  anything :-) 


2002-02-27     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMailConstants to set the version number
	  to 1.0.0.
	* Modified the GNUMailInfo.plist file to change the version
	  number to 1.0.0.


2002-02-26     Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a patch by Alexey I. Froloff <raorn@binec.ru> so that
          we don't use the extra code (it has been removed) for dealing
	  with base64 encoded text/* parts.
	* Set the CVS tag to v1_0_0pre3
	* RELEASED v1.0.0pre3


2002-02-25      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * modified docs/README
	* modified the OS X project file
	* modified MailboxManager.nib (to add the move/copy popup)
	* Added FontsView.nib and modified the OS X project to include
	  this file.
	* updated ReceivingView.nib
	* updated BounceWindow.nib


2002-02-25	Martin Brecher <martin@gnustep.de>

	* Updated German translation.


2002-02-24      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed extra call to [NSApp stopModal] in
          PreferencesWindowController: -windowWillClose.

        
2002-02-24	Erik Dalen <dalen@jpl.se>

	* LocalInboxWindowController.m: Simplified filter summary creation code


2002-02-24      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added missing keys to all Localization.strings files.


2002-02-24	Erik Dalen <dalen@jpl.se>

	* Updated Swedish translation.


2002-02-24      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated all Localization.strings files (regenerated from the sources)
          and updated the french translation.


2002-02-24	Erik Daln <dalen@jpl.se>

	* BounceWindow.m, EditWindow.m, GNUmakefile: Renamed stop.tiff to
	  MailIcon_stop.tiff


2002-02-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed some minor things in Erik's previous commits.


2002-02-23	Erik Daln <dalen@jpl.se>

	* LocalInboxWindowController.m: Fixed TODO-218 (Provide summary
	  of mailboxes that mail has been transferred to.)
	* ReceivingViewController.m: Fixed TODO-234 (Provide a 'default'
	  mail spool file)


2002-02-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed some minor things in Erik's previous commit.


2002-02-23	Erik Daln <dalen@jpl.se>

	* NewMailboxPanelController.m: Fixed TODO-233 (Rename filter targets
	  when renaming a mailbox)
	  This fix might leak some memory, but it works. But hey, it's
	  basically my first GNUstep coding :)


2002-02-22      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated Spanish translation. Patch from
	  Quique <quique@sindominio.net>.


2002-02-21      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: +attributedStringFromContentForPart:
	  mimeTypeManager: so that if we have a text/plain part
	  base64 encoded, but w/o any Content-Disposition, we reprensent
	  it as inline.
	* Small reorganization in the previous commit.
	* Updated MainMenu.nib
	* Added the sortBy* actions to GNUMail.h and also replaced
	  (void) by (IBAction) for those methods in GNUMail.m
	* Updated EditWindowController and Utilities so that the
	  ExtendedAttachmentCell works correctly under OSX.


2002-02-20      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Moved PreferencesWindowController: -instanceForBundleWithName
	  to the private category of that class. Also renamed it
	  _instanceForBundleWithName.
	* Fixed TODO#241 (NSOldSelectedCharacterRange isn't declared 
          under OSX). We use under OSX @"NSOldSelectedCharacterRange"
	  instead.
	* Moved BounceWindowController: -appendAdditionalHeadersToString
	  the a private category and renamed this method
	  _appendAdditionalHeadersToString.
	* Fixed a bug in BounceWindowController: -send. We were using
	  @"From -" and not @"From ".
	* Fixed a huge bug in LocalMailDelivery: -messagesFromMailspoolFile.
	  We were not considering the fact that "garbage" could follow
	  "From ". We now skip it properly.
	* Changed aRange.length = to aRange = in GNUMail.m:
	  -selectionInTextViewHasChanged.


2002-02-19      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified LocalInboxWindowController: -getNewMessages to use
 	  two autorelease pools (one inner pool, that we "rotate")
	  when fetching mails from the local mail spool file.
	* Modified MailWindowController: _loadAccessoryViews to set
	  the current superview to the bundle.
	* Updated the OS-X project file.
	* Fixed some file so it compiles cleanly under OSX.
	* Added PreferencesWindow.nib back to the project.
	* Added our new icons for the status column to the project.
	* Updated LocalInboxWindow.nib
	* Updated MailWindow.nib
	* Updated IMAPMailWindow.nib

 
2002-02-19  Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* Bundles/Receiving/ReceivingViewController.m ([-saveChanges]): 
	restart the timer if needed. Set the number of minutes before
	starting/restarting the timer.

2002-02-19      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified the GNUMailBundle protocol to include two new methods:
	  - (void) composeViewAccessoryWillBeRemovedFromSuperview: (NSView *) theView;
	  and
	  - (void) viewingViewAccessoryWillBeRemovedFromSuperview: (NSView *) theView;
	  so that our accessory views can be informed when they are going to be
	  removed from their superview.
	  Modified the Clock bundle (ClockWindowController) to implement
	  -viewingViewAccessoryWillBeRemovedFromSuperview:.
	* Added Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr> to the GNUMailInfo.plist
	  due to his major contributions to the project.


2002-02-19  Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	* PreferencesWindowController.m ([-addModuleToView:aModule]):
	  removed display call, the pref modules are now drawn faster.


2002-02-18	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Changed the installation path for all .prefs bundles from
	  GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT to GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR.
	* Implemented EditWindowController: -windowShouldClose to ask
	  for a confirmation before writing to the Drafts folder (not yet
	  implemented, we currently still use the dead.letter thing).
	* Changed EditWindowController: -sendMessage to call
	  tableViewShouldReloadData on the windowController instead of
	  reloadData on the tableView.
	* Added Utilities: + windowForFolderName that will return the
	  window owned by the MailWindowController object with the name
	  theName. Modified most of the code to use this method.
	* Added Drafts folder support. Implememented GNUMail:
	  -restoreDraft: and left -saveInDraft: "blank" for now.
	* Finished the Restore Draft feature. Added
	  EditWindowController: -setMessageFromDraftsFolder in order
	  to not set automatically the signature.
	* Added the "Save in Drafts" feature (Compose->Drafts). Implemented
	  GNUMail: -saveInDrafts and -setEnableSaveInDraftsMenuItem.
	  We now call this methods from EditWindowController and
	  MailWindowController.
	* Reorganized the Message menu.


2002-02-17      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added sample bundle in Bundles/Clock
        * Modified GNUMail to hold all the bundles (in allBundles)
        * Modified MailWindowController to add some hooks for the bundles.
	* Fixed the bug of flags that weren't kept when transferring messages
	  (moving or copying) between mailboxes. You need to update Pantomime
	  (make distclean; make).
	* We now remove the flag TRANSFERRED in transferred messages and we
	  call Folder: -updateCache if we transferred messages to rebuild 
          our cache.
	* Modified PreferencesWindowController: -instanceForBundleWithName
	  to load the bundles in 
          $GNUSTEP_INSTALLATION_DIR/{Local/Networl/System}
	  and not just Local. 
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController: -getNewMessages and
	  MailWindowController: -showMessage to set the app icon to
	  GNUMail_Full.tiff when new mails have been received and to set it back
	  to GNUMail.tiff when a unseen message has been read.
	* Added EditWindowController: -textDidChange (delegate method)
	  to set the window as 'dirty' if the content of the text view 
	  or the text fields has changed. Modified EditWindow to set the
	  delegate to the window controller to all text fields.


2002-02-16      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Activated the Find -> Enter Selection menu item. It enters the
          current selected text (in the last mail window on top) in the
          Find Panel's find field.
	* Moved all preferences panel modules to bundles (in Bundle).

	  the number of deleted messages and also to change the displayed
	  size of the selected message to %0.1f instead of %d.
	* Activated the spell checker for GNUstep.

	  for the status column (ExtendedCell).


2002-02-14      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added the feature to show/hide the sizes in MailWindow
  	  (ie., the label). It currently doesn't resize the table.
	  This completes the TODO #94.
	* Added two new contants in GNUMailConstants: SHOW_SIZES and
	  HIDE_SIZES to suppor the previous feature.


2002-02-14  Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>

	  of the Compact menu item to this method.
	* Commented some code in MailWindowController that
	  we won't use for now (FIXME).
	* Modified MailboxManagerController and
	  NewMailboxPanelController to rename the cache when 
	  renaming a mbox.
	* Moved _transferMessagesToTrashFolder from MailWindowController
	  (Private) to IMAPMailWindowController (Private) since  we
	  no longer use the Trash folder unless we're in IMAP mode
	  and the user has choosen to transfer its deleted 
	  messages locally in the Trash folder.
	* Added a GNUMail category for NSTableView in MailWindow
	  to fix the broken -deselectAll method in GNUstep GUI
	  0.7.5.

        * Added the FontsView/FontsViewController classes and
	  patches to use different fonts for the headers,
	  content of the message and more. Added Icons/fonts.tiff.

2002-02-11      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a Compact menu item to the Mailbox menu.
	  Currently unused.
	* Added two C functions in Utilities: striphtml() and
	  ent() from Abhijit Menon-Sen <ams@wiw.org>. Those
	  C functions allow us to strip the html codes from
	  html mails and keep only the good (ie., text)
	  information. Those functions are only used on GNUstep
	  since it has no currently no HTML support for
	  attributed strings.


2002-02-10      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a typo in the GNUMailInfo.plist file. We *must* use
          GNUMail.app and NOT GNUMail when referring to this application.


2002-02-09      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added Utilities: + (NSAttributedString *) 
          formattedAttributedStringFromAttributedString: 
          (NSAttributedString *) theAttributedString to add
          'smart placement of attachments' inside the body of a mail.

	  both copy and move.
	* Minor enhancements in Utilities that will speedup things.


2002-02-06      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	  preference name/value in the user's defaults
	  db: SIGNATURE_SOURCE

	  from a pipe to from our signature. This completes
	  TODO #237.
	* Modified AddressBookController: -toClicked,
	  -ccClicked and -bccClicked so that we can now
	  add all addresses from a group to the 
	  To/Cc/Bcc fields in the EditWindow (TODO #235)
	
	
2002-01-31	Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	  trying to show/hide all headers.
	* Added some TODOs
	* Updated all Localizable.strings files to add two missing
	  keys: "Local - %@" and "IMAP on %@ - %@".

        * Modified AddressBook: -groupForName to add some casting
          to keep the compiler quiet.
	* Modified AddressBookController so that we use -setTitle
	  instead of -setStringValue for setting the title of the
	  buttons dynamically.
	* Added AddressBookController: -selectionInBrowserHasChanged
	  that is only used under OS-X to call -browser: selectRow:
	  inColumn: since it's not called directly by Cocoa as it
	  should (?).


2002-01-26	Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Updated AddressBookWindow.nib (not yet finished)
	* Modified AddressBookController to reload the
	  column 0 when the address book has changed.
	* Modified IMAPMailWindowController: -windowWillClose
	  so that under OS-X, we don't try to aquire the lock.
	  This is a bug that needs to be fixed.
	* Modified EditWindowController.m and Utilities.m so that
	  under OS-X, we don't use ExtendedAttachmentCell.
	* Removed NewAddressPanel/NewAddressPanelController classes
	  since there's no longer needed. Modified the GNUmakefile

2002-01-25      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Rewrote entirely the address book. Added versionning
	  support in AddressBook so that we can load
	  previously defined addresses (TODO #197).
	* Disabled for now the -addToAddressBook method
	  in GNUMail.m.
	* Implemented the "Move To:" feature in the
	  address book.

	  an address that has the same description (ie., same
	  address's name/emailAddress values).
	* Updated the source for all wrongly formatted english
	  sentences. Patch from Ryan Cresawn <rcresawn@seva.net>.
	  Need to update all Localizable.strings files.

	
2002-01-24      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: +attributedStringFromContentForPart:
	                                          mimeTypeManager:
	  so that if our attachment cell's image is nil
	  (under Apple MacOS-X), we force it to the filewrapper's icon.
	* Done the same thing in EditWindowController: -insertFile.
	* Added a new class Group to manage groups of Address
	  objects in the Address Book.
	* Modified the GNUmakefile to include Group.h/.m when compiling.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -showMessage to properly refresh

	* Added Group.m/Group.h to the OS-X project file.
	* Modified Utilities.m and EditWindowController.m to
	  use -setFilename instead of -setFileName and -filename
	  instead of -fileName from Pantomime's Part class.

							  
2002-01-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: +attributedStringFromContentForPart:
        				          mimeTypeManager:
          so that if we got a text/rtf part, we show it properly
          using a NSAttributedString object initialized with the
          content of the RTF part.


2002-01-22      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added a private interface to MailWindowController and
	  defined _updateMessageSelectionUsingIndex: (int) theIndex
	  in it.
	* Modified MailWindowController to use this private
	  interface.
	* Added MailWindowContrller: -expungeDeletedMessages to
	  transfer immediately messages in the trash folder
	  and remove them from the current folder / folder view.
	* Added a new menu item "Expunge" in the Mailbox menu
	  that calls the new selector -expungeDeletedMessages.
	  This method calls MailWindowController:
	  -expungeDeletedMessages.
	* Modified MailWindowController to NOT use the
	  NSWindowDidBecomeKeyNotification but rather the
	  delegate method -windowDidBecomeKey.
	* Modified MailWindowController to use 
	  -removeMessage instead of -removeTransferredMessage
	  from Folder's class.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -transferMessagesToTrashFolder
	  to update the Trash folder window when it's opened. Otherwise,
	  we would lose the messages that were deleted.


2002-01-21      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified AddressBookWindow to add a Close button so that
	  if the window manager used doesn't really support our
	  closable window mask, the user can safely close the 
	  window of the address book.
	* Modified AddressBookWindowController: -initWithWindowNibName
	  to set the new height of our address book window.


2002-01-20      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Changed the GNUmakefile so GNUMail.app can link with the debug
          version of Pantomime. Patch from Richard Frith-Macdonald
          <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -deleteMessage so that we post
	  a notification that our message's selection has changed (even
	  if it's not true) when it's the very last message OR when
	  the selection count > 1 in order to rebuild our menu items
	  (delete/undelete) correctly. Bug reported by 
	  Richard Frith-Macdonald <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>.
	* Modified GNUMail to add the 'filters' menu allowing to 
	  apply filters manually on a number of selected messages (1 or more).
	* Renamed GNUMail: -removeAllItemsFromSendToAddressBookMenu
	  to -removeAllItemsFromMenu: (NSMenu *) theMenu and modified the
	  code in GNUMail.m to use this method.

	* Modified the GNUMail class so that we listen for the 
	  FiltersHaveChanged notification and if we receive it, we rebuild
	  our filters menu.
	* Modified GNUMail: -updateFilterMenuItems to use 'tag' for 
	  identifying which filter the user has selected. 
	* Modified the windows menu in the GNUMail class so that
	  we have by default three options: Arrange, Miniaturize
	  and Close (TODO #103).


2002-01-19      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified Utilities: +bestRepresentationFromMultipartAlternative
	  so that we verify if the text/plain part was base64 encoded
	  before assuming it was a plain NSString object.


2002-01-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added german translation of the service name in GNUMailInfo.plist.
          Patch from Martin Brecher <martin@mb-itconsulting.com>.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController to use -initWithHeadersFromString
	  instead of -initWithHeaders since this method has changed
	  in Pantomime.


2002-01-17      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMailConstants.m. Set the version number of GNUMail.app
	  to 1.0.0pre2.
	* Modified GNUMailInfo.plist to add the new two services.
	* Modified GNUMail to add our two new services (TODO #139).
	* Modified MailboxManagerController to use NSWindow's
	  orderFrontRegardless method instead of NSWindowController's
	  showWindow method so that if we change the focus when GNUMail.app
	  is 'loading' a folder, it'll get displayed properly.


2002-01-16	Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>

	* Changed buttons behavior from "Momentary Push In" to "Momentary Change"

        * Updated MainMenu.nib to include the Print menu and its submenus.
	* Updated EditWindow.nib to include the Cancel button.
	* Updated BounceWindowController to add an outlet for or Address Book
	  button and modified -windowDidLoad to set the target/action under OS-X.
	  Modified the BounceWindow nib in order to link the new outlet and
	  to NOT use an instance of the GNUMail class for this nib.
	  Cocoa seems to release all instances of objects inside the nib
	  even if it's not the owner. 
	* Done the same thing for EditWindowController/EditWindow.nib
	* Done the same thing for MailWindowController/MailWindow.nib
	* Updated LocalInboxWindow.nib and IMAPMailWindow.nib to connect

2002-01-11      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactored MimeUtility: +attributedStringFromContentForPart:
	  mimeTypeManager: and removed

	  of the NSASCIIStringEncoding when creating our NSData object
	  from our NSString object.
	* Added 4 new contants in GNUMailConstants: DELETE_MESSAGE,
	  UNDELETE_MESSAGE, MARK_AS_READ, MARK_AS_UNREAD for the
	  tags of menu items.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -deleteMessage to not change
	  the selection if the sender isn't the delete button.

	  to post our notification (SelectionOfMessageHasChanged)
	  everytime and not only when the message's selection count is 1.
	* Added in the GNUMail class a new menu item for setting the selection
	  of messages to read/unread and modified the 'undelete' on to

	  to 110/143 if the selection change (between POP3/IMAP) and it's not
	  a 'custom' port that was defined.
	* Modified GNUMailConstants. Introduced two new constants:
	  SIGNATURE_BEGINNING and SIGNATURE_END.
	* Implemented ComposeViewController: -initializeFromDefaults and
	  -saveChanges. Created two new properties in user's defaults db:
	  SIGNATURE_REPLY_POSITION and SIGNATURE_FORWARD_POSITION to
	  store the position of the signature for a reply and a forward.
	* Modified MailWindowController to set the signature at the
	  right position when doing a reply/replyToAll/forward.
	* Modified EditWindowController. Moved setSignature to _loadSignature.

	  and add it to the content of the textview at the right position.
	* Modified ComposeView to add the UI elements needed for specifying
	  the signature position.
	* Modified Utilities: +attributedStringFromContentForMessage:

          quoting characters by a simple | for now and indent properly
          the message. Modified -showMessage to call this new method.
	* Fixed a bug in MailboxManagerController:
	  -browser: willDisplayCell: atRow: column:. It should now correctly
	  show all your IMAP servers defined in the Receiving preferences.
	  It should NOT show any POP3 servers any more.
	* Modified Utilities: -attributedStringFromContentForMessage:
	  mimeTypeManager: to represent message/rfc822 parts as 
	  attachments when the Content-Disposition is set to
	  'attachment'.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -highlightAndActivateURLs to
	  support https://.
	* Updated PersonalView.nib.

	* Modified MailWindowController: -windowWillClose so that we
	  assign nil to lastMailWindowOnTop iif it was equal to self

	  on ShouldCloseMailbox since it was removed in -windowWillClose
	* Modified MailWindowController: -windowDidLoad to set the

	  editing of values in the SendingView table (for additionnal headers).
	* Same thing in ViewingView for shown headers.
	* Modified ViewingViewController: -addShown so that we don't add an header
	  to the shown headers if it's already there (ie., with the same name).
 	* Updated MacOS-X project file to include AddressTaker.h
	* Updated BounceWindow.nib	
	* Updated NewAddressPanel.nib (connected the cancel button)


2002-01-02      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindowController: -insertFile so that when we

        * Added two new classes: FilterHeaderEditorWindow to
          allow the users to specify in which headers to search
          for a criteria string for the filters and its controller,
          FilterHeaderEditorWindowController.
        * Added a new identifier (FilterHeaderEditorTableColumnIdentifier)
          for the table column used in FilterHeaderEditorWindow in
          GNUMailConstants.
        * Modified the GNUmakefile to include those files.
	* Modified FilterEditorWindowController. Added a new action

	  (verifying the content-disposition when showing text parts)
	* Done TOOD #118 ( when clicking for viewing an attachment, do 
	  this in a separate thread). Added MailWindowController:
	  -launchExternalProgram: and modified textView: clickedOnCell:...
	  to use this method when invoking an external program to
	  view an attachment. -launchExternalProgram: will be invoked
	  in a separate thread to not block GNUMail.app during its
	  execution.
	* Changed Utilities: -attributedStringFromContentForMessage: ...
	  so that we don't decode the extra alternative representation

          to highlight URLs in the message content.
        * Modified ViewingViewController to connect the outlet and
          to read/write the preference to the user defaults. The
          preference name is: HIGHLIGHT_URL.
        * Modified MailWindowController: -showMessage to use this
          new preference.

2001-12-28      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Modified NewAddressPanel.m. Inverted the position of the
	  ok and cancel buttons.
	* Added a new contant in GNUMailConstants for the GNUMail.app
	  version number. The contant name is GNUMAIL_VERSION.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -initMessageWithData to verify
	  if the X-Mailer additionnal header was defined. If Not, we define
	  it using the GNUMail.app version number.
	* Updated GNUMailInfo.plist with the correct version number and made
	  some other little corrections in the file.
	* Modified EditWindowController, IMAPView, MailboxManagerController
	  and NewMailboxPanelController to replace Ok by OK.
	* Modified ReceivingView.m, MIMEView.m and FilteringView.m 
	  to set the target of our tableView objects to the controller
	  in order to make the setDoubleAction work.
	* Added MailWindowController: -highlightAndActivateURLs to highlight
	  the URLs that we can 'decode' in the content of our message and
	  modified -showMessage to call this method after the 'decoding' is
	  done.
	  Also implemented the delegate method: textView:clickedOnLink:atIndex:
	  so that we open the 'clicked' url with our NSWorkspace object.
	* Changed _(@"") for @"" in FilterMessageWindowController:
	  -initWithWindowNibName.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -highlightAndActivateURLs to support
	  file:// and ftp:// links.
	* Corrected a typo (missing @) in FilterMessgeWindowController
	  -initWithWindowNibName when setting the title.
	* Modified TextEnrichedConsumer.h to make the class inherit from
	  NSObject.

	* Improved TransportMethodEditorWindow nib


2001-12-27      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	  and SendingViewController when -saveChanges is called.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -windowDidLoad and -dealloc to
	  add/remove the observer for our two notifications.
	* Modified MailWindowController: -setFolder to select the first
	  unread message instead of the last one of the mbox when it's first
	  opened.

	
2001-12-26      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified a comment in Utilities.m so it makes more sense.
	* Added PrefWindowController: +singleInstance to use a singleton
	  when the window is open (in order to prevent multiple preferences
	  window to be open at the same time)
	* Modified GNUMail: -showPrefWindow to use the singleInstance
	  method instead of creating directly a PrefWindowController object.
	* Added a matrix access in PrefWindowController and changed the
	  way we select the first cell. It should now work on GNUstep and
	  OS-X.


2001-12-25      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindowController: -initWithWindowNibName
          to verify that we have at least one transport agent defined.

	  and removed them from TODO list.
	* Added some other missing strings to the Swedish
	  Localizable.strings

2001-12-25      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Commented TransportMethodEditorWindowController:
          -transportMethodHasChanged
          [transportMethodPopUpButton setNextKeyView: smtpHostField]
          since it's causing a segfault. Could be a bug in GNUstep.
          Must investigate this problem.
	* Modified TransportMethodEditorWindowController:
	  -transportMethodHasChanged to set the next and previous key
	  view of our 'unused' objects to nil to prevent a bug in the AppKit
	  (in NSView: -dealloc, it can call 
	  [_nextKeyView setPreviousKeyView: nil] or
	  [_previousKeyView setNextKeyView: nil] on a view that has
	  been deallocated but the _nextKeyView or _previousKeyView
	  ivars are referencing a wrong (ie., deallacoted) object)
	* Re-enabled TransportMethodEditorWindowController:
	  -tableViewSelectionDidChange.
	* Modified SendingView: -layoutView to set the doubleAction
	  on editTransportMethod: for the transportTableView object.
	

2001-12-24      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

          and to implement the functionnalities of adding/editing
          and removing transport methods.
        * Modified TransportMethodEditorWindowController to implement
          the required functionnalities when adding or editing
          transport methods.
	* Modified GNUMailConstants to rename the identifiers used for the
	  additional headers table in SendingView and added two new identifiers
	  for the transport methods table in SendingView.
        * Modified EditWindowController.m to use the new sending options.
        * Modified GNUMail.m: -applicationDidFinishLaunching to convert
          the old sending options to the new model and to remove the
          unused keys.
	* Disabled the 'send' button in BounceWindow since this module
	  needs to be reworked for using the new sending values.
	* Done TODO #74 (multiple SMTP/personal profile support)
	  and removed it from the TODO list.
	* Added -transportMethodHasChanged to
	  TransportMethodEditorWindowController in order to set
	  the fields to editable (or not) when the selection of
	  Mailer/SMTP changes in the popup button and to set
	  correctly the nextKeyView for each UI element.

        
2001-12-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added our new class for specifying the name of our new
          personal profile (when we click on Add in PersonalView).
          The new class name is NewPersonalProfilePanel and it's controller
          NewPersonalProfilePanelController.
	* Modified the GNUmakefile to include those files.
	* Initial modification of PersonalViewController for using
	  NewPersonalProfilePanelController.
	* Finished the implementation of PersonalViewController for the
	  features related of adding and deleting personal profiles.
	  (implemented -addClicked and -deleteClicked).
	* Modified NewAddressPanel: -layoutPanel to set the keyEquivalent 
	  property of the okButton to @"\r" and also set the image and
	  alternate image.
	* Done the same thing in NewMailboxPanel and NewPersonalProfilePanel.
	* Removed extra #import "GNUMailConstants.h" in NewMailboxPanel.m
	  and NewPersonalProfilePanel.m
	* Added our new classes for specifying multiple transport methods and its
	  controller. The name is TransportMethodEditorWindow and
	  TransportMethodEditorWindowController.
	* Modified the GNUmakefile to include those files.
	* Refactored a little bit SendingViewController and SendingView in order
	  to be ready to accept this new class.
	* Done the UI in TransportMethodEditorWindow.

          
2001-12-22      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities: -attributedStringFromContentForMessage:
        		         	             mimeTypeManager:
          so that when we have a text/* message and the
          Content-Transfer-Encoding is quoted-printable, we don't
          decode the content since it has already be done in Pantomime.


2001-12-21      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Added two new NSPopUpButtons in EditWindow (with labels

	  and delivery settings to use when sending a particular
	  E-Mail.
	* Resized the table in FilteringView.m and moved the up/down.
	* Modified GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching to convert
	  the old personal preferences (EMAILADDR, NAME, ORGANIZATION
	  and REPLYTOADDR) to the new model. We also remove them
	  after having migrated them to the new model. Also, if
	  GNUMail.app wasn't configured before, we create a default
	  PERSONAL setting with blank values.
	* Modified PersonalView to use a box for displaying the informations
	  related to the 'personal' settings. An outlet 'box' has been
	  defined for this. Also, added a NSPopUpButton (with outlet name
	  'popUpButton') for being able to select which personal setting
	  we wand and also added two buttons (Add/Delete) to be able
	  to add or delete personal settings. Currently those buttons
	  do nothing.
	* Modified PersonalViewController to link our two new outlets
	  defined in PersonalView (box and popUpButton). Added three
	  new IBAction:
	  - okClicked
	  - deleteClicked
	  - changePersonalSelection
	  Modified -initializeFromDefaults and -saveChanges to use the
	  new preferences model.
	  Also added -_synchronizePersonalPreferencesWithCurrentSelection
	  to temporarily save the modified values to our allPersonalValues
	  ivar.
	* Added EditWindowController: _loadPersonalProfiles to populate
	  the fromPopUpButton with the profiles defined in the preferences
	  panel. Also linked the two outlets defined in EditWindow.
	  Also modified initMessageWithData to use the personal informations
	  from the selected profile in the fromPopUpButton.
	* Modified PasswordPanel: -layoutPanel to set the keyEquivalent property
	  of the okButton to @"\r" and also set the image and alternate image.
	  This is a 'test'.
	* Done the same thing in ReceivingWindow.
	* Done the same thing in PrefWindow.
	* Done the same thing in MimeTypeEditorWindow.
	* Done the same thing in FilterEditorWindow.
	* Changed [self class] to TextEnrichedConsumer in 
	  TextEnrichedConsumer: +attributedStringFromTextEnrichedString so
	  it compiles cleanly under OS-X.


2001-12-20      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ExtendedAttachmentCell to draw the cell
	  a little bit higher (same thing with the string) and 
	  we also now center the string under the attachment cell.
	* Added the new class TextEnrichedConsumer that allows to
	  produce a NSAttributedString <AppKit> from a text/enriched
	  content of a E-Mail part. Done TODO #208.
	* Modified Utilities.m to use 
	  TextEnrichedConsumer: +attributedStringFromTextEnrichedString
	  when it has to display the parts that has a text/enriched
	  Content-Type.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -insertFile to use the
	  ExtendedAttachmentCell when inserting attachments to an email.
	* Modified Utilities: +attributedStringFromContentForMessage:
						     mimeTypeManager:
	  to separate our body part for what was before it by adding a \n.
	* Done TODO #96. The menu item 'Undelete' in the Message menu
	  is now properly 'disabled' if a message can't be undeleted.
	* Modified MacOS-X project to include TextEnrichedConsumer.h/.m in
	  the build process.


2001-12-19      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Modified POP3View to add a new NSButton useAPOP for being
	  able to specify if we want to use APOP by default.
	* Modified ReceivingWindowController to load/save the new
	  USEAPOP preference.
        * Added the new key ("Use APOP (if possible)") in all
	  Localizable.strings file.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController to set the POP3Store
	  to use APOP or not depending on the user's default USEAPOP.
	* Added a new class: ExtendedAttachmentCell that displays the filename
	  of a NSTextAttachment with the representation in the cell.
	* Modified the GNUmakefile to include ExtendedAttachmentCell.h/.m
	* Modified Utilities.m to make use of the ExtendedAttachmentCell.
	* Added missing #import GNUMailConstants.h in ExtendedAttachmentCell.m
	* Updated MacOS-X project.


2001-12-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified a wrongly spelled string "comminication"
	  instead of "communication". Updated LocalInboxWindowController,
	  MailboxManagerController and all Localizable.strings files.
	* Modified EditWindowController: -initMessageWithData to correctly
	  set the Organization and the Reply-To header values since Pantomime
	  was modified to not rely on NSUserDefaults anymore.
	

2001-12-18	Martin Brecher <martin@gnustep.org>

	* Update German translation


2001-12-18      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Renamed LocalInboxWindowController: -transferMessagesFromFolder: ...
	  to -transferMessagesFromPOP3Folder so it makes more sense.
	* Moved the filter matching code to LocalInboxWindowController:
	  -matchFilterRuleFromRawSource: count: and modified
	  transferMessagesFromPOP3Folder: count: to use it.
	* Modified LocalMailDelivery to return an array of messages
	  as raw source (in -messagesFromMailspoolFile) instead of 
	  transferring them directly to a folder.
	* Refactored LocalInboxWindowController: -getNewMessages
	  to activate filters for LocalMailDelivery and moved some
	  code to alert the users so that it is used for both POP3
	  and LocalMailDelivery. TODO #203 is partially done.
	* Added IMAPMailWindowController: -setFolder that calls
	  [super setFolder: theFolder] and also starts the timer
	  for fetching new emails in IMAP. Moved the code from
	  -windowDidLoad since the folder wasn't set, [self folder]
	  was of course returning nil.

	
2001-12-17      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified LocalInboxWindowController -getNewMessages
	  so that if an error occurs while trying to connect to

	  IMAP servers.
	* Added some todos.
	* Changed GNUMailInfo.plist to set the version number to

	  Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>.
	* Modified FilteringView.nib for MacOS-X. Patch from
	  Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>.
	* Added missing keys for new strings in all
	  Localizable.strings files. Also updated the french
	  translation for those strings.
	* Modified LocalInboxWindowController: -getNewMessages
	  to actually put the alert panel for a wrong password
	  at the place we had it before I made the changes

2001-12-14      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified AddressBookController: -windowDidLoad to

	* Fixed autosizing of MIMEView.nib


2001-11-29      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	  not.
	* Modified ReceivingViewController so that -getMailspooFile is
	  defined as an IBAction
	* Updated some nibs.
	* Modified MIMEViewController: -initWithNibName so that under
 	  MacOS-X, we link manually the table columns outlets since you
	  CANNOT connect them in IB if the view isn't in a NSWindow. That's
	  silly.
	* Done the same thing in SendingViewController
	* Fixed a remove bug in ReceivingViewController. The way it was
	  done would make it impossible to remove a pop3/imap server
	  under MacOS-X

	  [[popup selectedCell] stringValue].

	  to set the window title before the end of 
	  -initWithWindowNibName in order to load the window
	  from the nib immediately.
	* Modified Utilites.m to support multipart/appledouble
	  content types. Refactored the class to reuse the code
	  as much as possible.
	* Added a #ifndef MACOSX in GNUMail: -applicationWillFinishLaunching
	  so we don't declare the action variable under OS-X


2001-11-28	Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>
	
	* Improved BounceWindow.nib, PrefWindow.nib, NewAddressWindow.nib,

	  it's a weak reference. Modified -dealloc to release the 
	  view under OS-X too.
	* Added a Cancel button in EditWindow
	* New common_Unknown.tiff, up.tiff and down.tiff images that 
	  will work on OS-X.
	  Done by Francis Lachapelle <francis@Sophos.ca>
 	* Added missing @end in MIMEViewController
	* Updated Project file and MainMenu.nib
	

2001-11-26      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed Utilities: GNUMailUserLibraryPath(). It was returning the
	  wrong path under OS-X.

          content type object.

          to use this new method.
	* Modified PrefWindowController: -addModuleToView to not
	  set the content view of the box to aModule if aModule is
	  already the content view of the box.
	* Fixed a small size problem of the Status column in MailWindow. 
	* Added PasswordPanel.nib, RAWSourceWindow.nib and
          MimeTypeEditorWindow.nib and ReceivingWindow.nib

	  from MailWindow to MailWindowController
	* Modified PrefWindowController to call [NSApp stopModal]
	  when the ok/cancel buttons are clicked. Added

	  this.


2001-11-23      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

2001-11-22      Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Moved the type of lastMailWindowOnTop from
	  MailWindow * to id since we don't compile
	  MailWindow under MacOS-X.
	* Removed some compiler warnings in MailWindowController
	* Defined the menus (and menu items) as IBOutlets in
	  GNUMail.h and now we don't include the manual menu
	  creation in GNUMail.m: -applicationWillFinishLaunching
	  under MacOS-X since we are going to use the MainMenu
	  nib.
	* Updated Swedish translation, patch from Erik Dalen.
	* Removed debug output in MailWindowController
	* Modified MailboxManagerController, EditWindowController
	  and MailWindowController so we use folderForName:

	* Removed the dependancy of MailWindow (the class) in
	  EditWindowController and MailboxManagerController by adding
	  a mutable array of opened windows in GNUMail.m. Added
	  acessors and methods to add and remove an opened window.
	  Modified MailWindowController to add the window in
	  -windowDidLoad and to remove it in -windowWillClose.

	* Updated German translation


2001-11-15  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified BounceWindowController since I rewrote
	  entirely the way messages are bounced.
	* Added -appendAdditionalHeadersToString to the
	  BounceWindowController class. This method
	  appends the additional headers defined when bouncing

	* Commented a NSLog in EditWindowController


2001-11-13  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Finished TODO #153. We now use the charset defined

	* Modified EditWindowController to encode the filename
	  in QP in case we need to.

	  HERE NEEDS TO BE FIXED)
	* Modified MimeType: - (int) setType -> (void) setType
	* Added #ifndef MACOSX #import "...Window.h" in all
	  controller classes and refactored most of these
	  controller classes.


2001-11-10  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Integrated a patch from Jeff Teunissen <deek@d2dc.net>
          that allows to have a ~/gnumail of your choice and
          an Inbox/Outbox/Trash folder of your choice. Currently,
          it's only configurable through the tool 'defaults'.

          The new keys are: LOCALMAILDIR, INBOXFOLDERNAME,
          OUTBOXFOLDERNAME and TRASHFOLDERNAME.
	* Finished the mailbox rename feature
	* Updated localization files with minor modifications
	* It's now possible to desactivate the local mail spoo
	  file mail transferring feature from the ReceivingView
	  preference panel (TODO #174)

        * In IMAPMailWindowController, replaced NSDebugLog
	  by NSLog
        * Added a file called NIBS that describes how nibs are
	  used in GNUMail.app
        * Modified PasswordPanelController to be able to load
	  nibs (for MacOS-X). Modified the classes that depends

2001-11-09  Vincent Ricard <vricard@wanadoo.fr>

        * Fix TODO #177 and #178 (translate some strings to english
	  and french)


2001-11-08  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Integrated a patch from Vincent Ricard that modifies
	  the way flags are set when doing a delete operation
	  on multiple messages at the same time. The usability is
	  now better.
	* Now prompts a panel to ask you if you want to reply to
	  all recipients when replying to a mail.

	
2001-11-08  Martin Brecher <martin@gnustep.de>

	* Updated German translation


2001-11-08  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Removed the #ifdef in NSStringExtensions.h
	* Now imports NSStringExtensions.h in FindWindowController.m
	  MailWindowController.m and MimeTypeManager.m
	* Initial support for being able to rename mailboxes.
	  Only the UI is done.
	

2001-11-07  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Minor updated for the french translation from TODO #175
	* Removed the code the send the 
	  NSTableViewSelectionDidChangeNotification
	  in MailWindowController: -deleteMessage since the notification 
	  is actually fired in selectRow. If the index stays the same, we
	  don't need to fire his notification.
        * Modified NSStringExtensions so that if we are under GNUstep, we
          use the method stringByTrimmingSpaces which is quite efficient.
          Otherwise, we use our own method.
	* Updated the Swedish translation. Patch from Erik Dalen for TODO #175
	* We now store password in an encrypted format. Patch from 
	  Vincent Ricard. TODO #117 is done.


2001-11-07  Vincent Ricard <vricard@wanadoo.fr>

        * fix TODO #175 (translate the new strings in EditWindowController.m)


2001-11-07  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Refactored MailboxManagerController
	* Fixed a range bug in NSStringExtensions -stringByTrimmingWhiteSpaces
	* Updated the GNUmakefile to include NSStringExtensions in the build


2001-11-06  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified MailWindowController so we do an extra
	  check on the filename if the Content-Type is image/*
	* Modified EditWindowController: -initMessageWithData
	  so we verify each recipients before sending the email
	  to be sure that they are all correctly formatted.
	* Fixed two small memory leaks in EditWindowController
	* Modified NSStringExtensions so that we always use our own
	  version of stringByTrimmingWhiteSpaces since GNUstep's version
	  consumes a mammoth amount of RAM.


2001-11-05  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * When marking a mail as 'deleted', we scroll to the row
	  that we have selected.


2001-11-02  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified LocalInboxWindowController and
	  IMAPMailWindowController so that we try to aquire the
	  lock instead of 'forcing' to aquire it.
	* Initial implementation of text parts defined in
	  mime/multipart messages as an attachment.
	* Modified IMAPMailWindow so we now call the right
	  getNewMessages selector.
	* Done some refactoring in MailWindowController and fixed
	  memory leaks.
	

2001-11-01  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified EditWindow.m and MailWindow.m so that we
	  in include insets of 5,5 for our NSTextView object.
	* We now show a \n before a message/rfc822 part.
	* GNUMailConstants: removed unused thread notification
	* Replaced the thread by a timer in LocalInboxWindowController
	  and IMAPMailWindowController.
	* Removed unused code in GNUMail.app since we don't need
	  to wait until threads are closed in order to quit
	  the application.
	* Removed some debug informations in RAWSourceWindow


2001-10-31  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Some refactoring in some classes (GNUMail.m)
	* Modified PrefWindowController so we now encode
	  properly the text/plain message if it is using
	  charsets other than us-ascii. Now need to do for
	  text body parts.
	* Added a new method in EditWindowController:
	  - (void) parseBodyText: (NSString *) theString
	                  inPart: (Part *) thePart;
	  in order to generalize the process of attaching
	  text parts to a message with the right encoding.
	  Finalized this process.
	* Refactored MailWindow (a little bit)
	* Removed unused strings in all language files

	
2001-10-30  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed TODO# 172. It's now possible to send messsages
	  when the Outbox folder is open.
	* Initial support for keeping the size and position of
	  EditWindow in users's defaults. It's currently desactivated
	  since we must fix the resize bug first.


2001-10-29  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Implement the support of image/* as the only content of a message
	  You need the latest Pantomime for this.
	* Some cleanups in the preference panel views.


2001-10-26  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a little bug in all local files ("Reply all" -> "Reply All")
	* Updated the french translation (Patch from Stephane Peron)
	

2001-10-25  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Completely moved MailWindow to a MVC design. Introduced controller
	  classes for LocalInboxWindow, IMAPMailWindow and MailWindow.
	* Updated the code everywhere since we introduced those classes.
	  Need to do a lot of testing now.
	* Updated the swedish translation
	* Initial implementation of the feature "new message from
	  dead.letter"
	* Updated the english translation to include the new strings
	  for the dead.letter feature.
	* Updated the french translation (same as above)
	* Reactivated the 'get new messages' feature from the menu

	* Updated the german tranlsation (for the dead.letter feature)
	* Released 0.8.0pre2

	
2001-10-24  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Updated the swedish translation.
	* In RAWSourceWindow, replaced the FastTextView by a NSTextView
	  so copy & paste is now allowed.
	* Modified MailWindow: -deleteMessage so that when we delete a 
	  message (or more than one), we jump to the message
	  after the last one beeing deleted and we show it.

	
2001-10-23  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Changed NSImageOverlaps by NSImageOnly in MailboxManager.m
	  and in AddressBookWindow.m
	* Modified the way we create our tableView object in MailWindow.
	* Modified RECT_MAILWINDOW so we save int values and not float
	  values.
	* We now show text/enriched strings without formatting (and we
	  inform the user that no formatting will be done).
	* Modified Utilities: GNUMailUserLibraryPath so that we don't 
	  call NSStandardLibraryPath() under MacOS-X since there seems
	  to be a bug when linking GNUMail.app.
	* In AddressBookController: -deleteAddress we now prompt the user
	  before deleting the address.
	* Translated in english the message above.
	* Removed (commented) SendingView: -setMode since it was causing
	  problems under MacOS-X.
	* Reactivated the -setMode. We now call
	  [popup synchronizeTitleAndSelectedItem]; so it fixes the problem
	  we had before.
	* Modified ReceivingWindowController: -setType so we now call
	  [[receivingWindow popup] synchronizeTitleAndSelectedItem]; to
	  fix the selection bug in the popup button.
	* Removed [textView setImportsGraphics: YES]; from MailWindow since
	  the bug was corrected in GNUstep.
	* Updated the French translation.


2001-10-22  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified Utilities.m and GNUMail.m to activate the feature
	  of keeping the size and position of the mail window. I think
	  we should 'deploy' this feature to all windows but, should we 
	  deploy it on a per-window basis? To see..
	* Partially fixed the bugs of window resize in EditWindow. We
	  need to add the Cc/Bcc labels and fields relatively to our
	  current objects and not at fixed sizes.
	* Modified more UI code for nil error checking (for MacOS-X).
	  Done ReceivingWindowController, LabelWidget, MailWindow and
	  EditWindowController.
	* Fixed a potential crash in MailboxManagerController if the
	  RECEIVING key wasn't defined in standardUserDefaults.
	* Modified GNUMail.m so we now invoke
	  [[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop] runMode: NSDefaultRunLoopMode
	                           beforeDate: [NSDate distantFuture]];
	  in -cleanQuit: when waiting for the thread to be stopped.
	* In GNUMail: -applicationDidFinishLaunching: we now verify if
	  we really need to create ~/gnumail and Inbox/Outbox/Trash. If
	  they are already present, we skip the creation of those files.
	* Fixed a bug in MailboxManagerController if RECEIVING wasn't
	  defined. We were not showing the Local folder!
	* Disable the saving of RECT_MAILWINDOW since there's a bug
	  in GNUstep.


2001-10-21  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ViewingView so it works better under MacOS-X.
	* Same thing for SendingView and ReceivingView.
	* Initial support of keeping the size of the windows
	  once they've been resized (only for MailWindow for now, and
	  it's not really working so it's disabled in Utilities.m).
	* In MailboxManagerController, we now set the mask to "resizable"
	  to newly created windows too.


2001-10-21  Jonathan B. Leffert <jbl@foo>

        * Removed all imports of NSWindowController.h now that CVS current
	  of GNUstep core is required.


2001-10-21  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified PersonalView so that it works under MacOS-X.
          We must do the same for all other views.


2001-10-20  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small memory leak in PasswordPanel.
          We now release iconButton.


2001-10-19  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Again, new French translation from Stephane Peron
	* Fixed the bug when sending a Message in EditWindow. That
	  bug was in fact in GNUstep and you now MUST have the most
	  recent version of GNUstep in order to run GNUMail.app
	  properly.
	* New version of the German translation from Martin Brecher.
	* New file WHOIS that describes who are working on GNUMail.app
	  and what they do.
	* Modified MailboxManagerController so it's now possible to transfer
	  messages in opened mailboxes (TODO #66).
	* Cleaned MailWindow: -dealloc. We weren't doing right when removing
	  our observers.
	* Modified the 'nextKeyView' in PasswordPanel
	* Added a Swedish translation from Erik Dalen <dalen@jpl.nu>.

	
2001-10-18  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed EditWindow: -dealloc of bodyText. That was caused by a
	  serious bug of GNUstep that I've fixed on Oct. 18 2001. You MUST
	  upgrade your CVS sources of GNUstep otherwise, GNUMail.app will
	  crash (actually, GNUstep GUI) if you try to re-open an EditWindow
	  after closing one.
	* Updated the French translation. Patch from Stephane Peron
	  <s.peron@free.fr>
	* Put back the setImportGraphics: YES in MailWindow for the textView
	  since we can't click on attachments otherwise. This breaks copy
	  /paste in the textView. This is a bug in GNUstep for sure.
	* In EditWindowController: -sendMessage we now close the Outbox
	  folder BEFORE the window.
	* Removed unused code in EditWindowController: -windowWillClose
	* Applied a small patch from Pierre-Yves Rivaille 
	  <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr> to clean-up MailWindow:
	  -removeTransferredMessages.


2001-10-17  Vincent Ricard <vricard@wanadoo.fr>

	* the localization is ready (all files are localizated)


2001-10-17  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a memory leak in ViewingView.
	* Added french translation from Stephane Peron <s.peron@free.fr>
	* Fixed a memory leak in MailcapWindowController that would cause
	  a segfault.
	* Fixed the release of singletons for preferences. We need to
	  fix the bug in NSTableView for that (we retain the dataSource and
	  we should not). Modified all the preferences view to set the
	  singleInstance static variable to nil when -dealloc is called.
	* Fixed a memory leak in ReceivingWindow. We were not releasing
	  our tab view items. There's a bug in GNUstep and you must have
	  the most recent version of GNUstep GUI in order to use GNUMail.app
	  now.
	* Removed some NSLog that were quite annoying at run-time
	* Cleaned some things while creating the bodyText in MailWindow.
	* Removed the setImportGraphics call so that copy/paste now works
	  from bodyText.
	* In BounceWindowController: -messageInitializationWasSuccessful
	  we verify that at least one To has been defined.


2001-10-16  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified ReceivingWindow/ReceivingWindowController so that 
	  we can now use the "remember password" feature.
	* Implemented PasswordPanel and PasswordPanelController for
	  prompt password.
	* Implemented 'prompt for password' in LocalInboxWindow.m
	  with a password cache so we don't ask for a correct password
	  more than one time.
	* Implemented MailboxManagerController: -passwordForServerName
	  for being able to prompt the password for an IMAP connection.
	* Completed the support for 'prompt password' for IMAP folders.
	* Fixed a small bug in MailWindow. We moved back the clearing
	  our of textView in showMessage.
	* Changed the delegate to the window controller in EditWindow
	  for the subject text field.
	* We now give to the user a better explaination when we can't
	  open the LocalStore.
	* Now includes Utilities.h in GNUMail.m
	* Fixed a serious bug in PrefWindowController. The PersonalView
	  was never saved!
	* Integrated a patch from Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>
	  so that in removeTransferredMessage, the notification is fired
	  when the selection changes.
	* Updated the German translation. Patch from Martin Brecher
	  <martin@stupid-design.com>.
	

2001-10-16  Vincent Ricard <vricard@wanadoo.fr>

	* the localization continues (localizated files: Address.m to
	  LabelWidget.m)


2001-10-16  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * In MailWindow: -removeTransferredMessages, changed
	  if (firstIndexOfSelection >= ([folder count] - 1) to
	  if (firstIndexOfSelection > ([folder count] - 1). Patch
	  from Pierre-Yves Rivaille <pyrivail@ens-lyon.fr>.
	* Modified MailWindow: -showSelectedMessage (renamed to showMessage)
	  and -attributedStringFromContentForMessage in order to support
	  mime body part of content-type message/rfc822
	* Some minor cleanups in GNUMail.m
	* Added the German translation (initial translation) from
	  Martin Brecher <martin@stupid-design.com>
	* Fixed a bug in GNUMail.m (showSelectedMessage -> showMessage)
	* Fixed a bug in GNUMail.m if the Inbox folder of the local store
	  was not present. There's still a strange segfault on exit. Must
	  fix that one.

	
2001-10-15  Vincent Ricard <vricard@wanadoo.fr>

	* beginning of the english localization (just GNUMail.m
	  for the moment)


2001-10-15  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * in ReceivingWindow, removed the #import <crypt.h>

	  localization.


2001-10-12  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Moved the buttons +/- in AddressBookWindow so that we have the
	  same UI consistency between AddressBookWindow and MailboxManager

        * Fixed a crash in EditWindow since we were using object
          that was autoreleased.
	* Modified MimeTypeEditorWindowController to make it more
	  OpenStep friendly. (modified MIMEView and MimeTypeEditorWindow too).
	* Same thing with ReceivingWindowController
	* Same thing with MailcapWindowController. Created a memory leak?
	* Same thing with NewMailboxPanelController
	* Initial fix of selection when adding/removing mailboxes in the
	  MailboxManagerController.

	* Removed CreateWindow and replaced everything by a MVC design.
	  Introduced NewMailboxPanel and NewMailboxPanelController.
	* Moved BounceWindow to a MVC design and introduced
	  BounceWindowController


2001-10-06  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

	* Fixed a bug in GNUMail: -init. We now try to open the local
	  store in -applicationDidFinishLaunching instead.


2001-10-05  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Fixed a small bug into EditWindow: -sendMessage.
	  the Outbox folder wasn't closed if there was an error
	  occuring while sending the message. It would no longer
	  allow the user to send the message.

        * When we forward emails, we ensure now that we display the
	  images directly instead as an icon. (TODO #148)
	* Major bugfix in MailWindow: -showSelectedMessage. We now
	  verify the contentTransferEncoding for message with a content
	  type text/plain BEFORE showing them. So that we support
	  message sent using base64/qp/none/8bit.
	* We do the samething too, to the Messages with a content
	  type text/plain.

	
2001-10-03  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Now support the Description when reading from /etc/mailcap

	  folder (needs work on the IMAPMailWindow).
	* Fixed a memory leak in RAWSourceWindow
	* Added MailboxManagerController: -windowWillClose to add the
	  delegate back when the window has been close. Should we really
	  do that or is it a bug in GNUstep GUI?
	

2001-10-02  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Modified GNUMail.app so it now uses the new 'memory model'
	  of Pantomime.
	* Corrected some memory bugs in Mailcap*
	* In MailWindow, we now ensure that before appending an
	  attributed string to maStr (in -showSelectedMessage), the
	  attributed string is in the autorelease pool.
	  Modified -attributedStringWithString too, to reflect those
	  changes.
	* Now every .m includes Constants.h in order to define the
	  RETAIN/RELEASE/... placeholders if we are not using
	  GNUstep
	* Fixed two small bugs in MailWindow: -removeTransferredMessages.
          We now 'cache' the messages to delete and we now verify that the

	  are found (TODO #148)

	  opening a MailWindow.


2001-09-28  Ludovic Marcotte <ludovic@Sophos.ca>

        * Imported source on CVS - module GNUMail
	* GNUMail.app now writes temporary the images received
	  as attachments to a file in order to support more
	  image types by directly showing them in the MailWindow.
	  It now uses all formats supported by libwraster.
	* Integrated the /etc/mailcap parser from Vincent Ricard.
	  Some cleanups need to be done in the code (I've done some)

          following values: Date, From, To, Cc, Subject

	
2001-08-05  Jonathan B. Leffert  <jbl@foo>

	* Source/EditWindow.m ([EditWindow -insertFile:sender]): code cleanup.

	* Source/GNUMail.m ([GNUMail -applicationDidFinishLaunching:]):
	we were calling [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"foo", @"bar", @"hat"]
	instead of [NSArray arrayWithObjects: @"foo", @"bar", @"hat",
	nil].  this was causing a segfault.  changed [self showPrefWindow:
	nil] to [self showPrefWindow: self], which is cleaner.

	* Source/LocalMailDelivery.m ([LocalMailDelivery -init]): in
	the case that there is no local mail spool, we were releasing
	self and returning nil.  it's probably better to autorelease
	self and return nil.

Since Version 0.5:

- Find panel has been implemented (todo #56)

  you want to see/hide. Current users of GNUMail.app would probably want to
  add the following values in the hidden list: {TODO}
- Fixed a bug in InboxWindow if POP3 couldn't establish a connection
- cleaned the API in Message/Part/MimeBodyPart
- The sources are now on CVS
